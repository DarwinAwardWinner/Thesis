CD4 T-cells are central to all adaptive immune responses, as well as immune
 memory [CITE?].
 After an infection is cleared, a subset of the naive CD4 T-cells that responded
 to that infection differentiate into memory CD4 T-cells, which are responsible
 for responding to the same pathogen in the future.
 Memory CD4 T-cells are functionally distinct, able to respond to an infection
 more quickly and without the co-stimulation requried by naive CD4 T-cells.
 However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this functional distinction
 are not well-understood.
 Epigenetic regulation is thought to be

Generally, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 are often observed in the promoters of highly
 transcribed genes, while H3K27me3 is more often observed in promoters of
 inactive genes with little to no transcription occurring.
 The causal relationship between these histone modifications and gene transcript
ion is complex, and likely involves positive and negative feedback loops
 between the two.

 Briefly, this data consists of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq from CD4 T-cells cultured
 from 4 donors.
 From each donor, naive and memory CD4 T-cells were isolated separately.
 Then cultures of both cells were activated [how?], and samples were taken
 at 4 time points: Day 0 (pre-activation), Day 1 (early activation), Day
 5 (peak activation), and Day 14 (post-activation).
 For each combination of cell type and time point, RNA was isolated and
 sequenced, and ChIP-seq was performed for each of 3 histone marks: H3K4me2,
 H3K4me3, and H3K27me3.
 The ChIP-seq input DNA was also sequenced for each sample.
 The result was 32 samples for each assay.

 Each quantification was tested with both Ensembl transcripts and UCSC known
 gene annotations [CITE? Also which versions of each?].
 Comparisons of downstream results from each combination of quantification
 method and reference revealed that all quantifications gave broadly similar
 results for most genes, so shoal with the Ensembl annotation was chosen
 as the method theoretically most likely to partially mitigate some of the
 batch effect in the data.

Due to an error in sample preparation, the RNA from the samples for days
 0 and 5 were sequenced using a different kit than those for days 1 and
 14.
 This induced a substantial batch effect in the data due to differences
 in sequencing biases between the two kits, and this batch effect is unfortunate
ly confounded with the time point variable (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 To do the best possible analysis with this data, this batch effect was
 subtracted out from the data using ComBat 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, ignoring the time point variable due to the confounding with the batch
 variable.
 The result is a marked improvement, but the unavoidable counfounding with
 time point means that certain real patterns of gene expression will be
 indistinguishable from the batch effect and subtracted out as a result.
 Specifically, any

 pattern, such as a gene whose expression goes up on day 1, down on day
 5, and back up again on day 14, will be attenuated or eliminated entirely.
 In the context of a T-cell activation time course, it is unlikely that
 many genes of interest will follow such an expression patter, so this loss
 was deemed an acceptable cost for correcting the batch effect.

However, removing the systematic component of the batch effect still leaves
 the noise component.
 The gene quantifications from the first batch are substantially noisier
 than those in the second batch.
 This analysis corrected for this by using limma's sample weighting method
 to assign lower weights to the noisy samples of batch 1 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The results are summarized in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Latent factors 1, 4, and 5 were determined to explain the most variation
 consistently across all data sets (Fgure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:mofa-varexplained"
plural "false"
caps "false"

), and scatter plots of these factors show that they also correlate best
 with the experimental factors (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:mofa-lf-scatter"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Latent factor 2 captures the batch effect in the RNA-seq data.
 Removing the effect of LF2 using MOFA theoretically yields a batch correction
 that does not depend on knowing the experimental factors.
 When this was attempted, the resulting batch correction was comparable
 to ComBat (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:RNA-PCA-ComBat-batchsub"
plural "false"
caps "false"

 improvement given the problems with the data set.

Genes called present in the RNA-seq data were tested for differential expression
 between all time points and cell types.
 The counts of differentially expressed genes are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Estimated-and-detected-rnaseq"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Notably, all the results for Day 0 and Day 5 have substantially fewer genes
 called differentially expressed than any of the results for other time
 points.
 This is an unfortunate result of the difference in sample quality between
 the two batches of RNA-seq data.
 All the samples in Batch 1, which includes all the samples from Days 0
 and 5, have substantially more variability than the samples in Batch 2,
 which includes the other time points.
 This is reflected in the substantially higher weights assigned to Batch
 2 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:RNA-seq-weights-vs-covars"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The batch effect has both a systematic component and a random noise component.
 While the systematic component was subtracted out using ComBat (Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:RNA-PCA"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), no such correction is possible for the noise component: Batch 1 simply
 has substantially more random noise in it, which reduces the statistical
 power for any differential expression tests involving samples in that batch.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the difficulty in detecting specific differentially expressed genes,
 there is still evidence that differential expression is present for these
 time points.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:rna-pca-final"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, there is a clear separation between naive and memory samples at Day 0,
 despite the fact that only 2 genes were significantly differentially expressed
 for this comparison.
 Similarly, the small numbers of genes detected for the Day 0 vs Day 5 compariso
ns do not reflect the large separation between these time points in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:rna-pca-final"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 In addition, the MOFA latent factor plots in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:mofa-lf-scatter"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 This suggests that there is indeed a differential expression signal present
 in the data for these comparisons, but the large variability in the Batch
 1 samples obfuscates this signal at the individual gene level.
 As a result, it is impossible to make any meaningful statements about the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

size
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the gene signature for any time point, since the number of significant
 genes as well as the estimated number of differentially expressed genes
 depends so strongly on the variations in sample quality in addition to
 the size of the differential expression signal in the data.
 Gene-set enrichment analyses are similarly impractical.
 However, analyses looking at genome-wide patterns of expression are still
 practical.

 gives a summary of the peak calling statistics for each histone mark.
 Consistent with previous observations [CITATION NEEDED], all 3 histone
 marks occur in broad regions spanning many consecutive nucleosomes, rather
 than in sharp peaks as would be expected for a transcription factor or
 other molecule that binds to specific sites.
 This conclusion is further supported by Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:CCF-with-blacklist"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, in which a clear nucleosome-sized periodicity is visible in the cross-correlat
ion value for each sample, indicating that each time a given mark is present
 on one histone, it is also likely to be found on adjacent histones as well.
 H3K27me3 enrichment in particular is substantially more broad than either
 H3K4 mark, with a mean peak width of almost 19,000 bp.
 This is also reflected in the periodicity observed in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, which remains strong much farther out for H3K27me3 than the other marks,
 showing H3K27me3 especially tends to be found on long runs of consecutive
 histones.

We hypothesized that if naive cells had differentiated into memory cells
 by Day 14, then their patterns of expression and histone modification should
 converge with those of memory cells at Day 14.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:PCoA-promoters"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 shows the patterns of variation in all 3 histone marks in the promoter
 regions of the genome using principal coordinate analysis.
 All 3 marks show a noticeable convergence between the naive and memory
 samples at day 14, visible as an overlapping of the day 14 groups on each
 plot.
 This is consistent with the counts of significantly differentially modified
 promoters and estimates of the total numbers of differentially modified
 promoters shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Number-signif-promoters"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 For all histone marks, evidence of differential modification between naive
 and memory samples was detected at every time point except day 14.
 The day 14 convergence pattern is also present in the RNA-seq data (Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:RNA-PCA-group"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), albiet in the 2nd and 3rd principal coordinates, indicating that it is
 not the most dominant pattern driving gene expression.
 Taken together, the data show that promoter histone methylation for these
 3 histone marks and RNA expression for naive and memory cells are most
 similar at day 14, the furthest time point after activation.
 MOFA was also able to capture this day 14 convergence pattern in latent
 factor 5 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:mofa-lf-scatter"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), which accounts for shared variation across all 3 histone marks and the
 RNA-seq data, confirming that this convergence is a coordinated pattern
 across all 4 data sets.
 While this observation does not prove that the naive cells have differentiated
 into memory cells at Day 14, it is consistent with that hypothesis.

landscape
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of ChIP-seq read coverage in naive Day 0 samples within 5 kb of each gene's
 TSS by binning reads into 500-bp windows tiled across each promoter LogCPM
 values were calculated for the bins in each promoter and then the average
 logCPM for each promoter's bins was normalized to zero, such that the values
 represent coverage relative to other regions of the same promoter rather
 than being proportional to absolute read count.
 The promoters were then clustered based on the normalized bin abundances
 using

-means clustering with 
\begin_inset Formula $K=6$

 Different values of

 the data.

\begin_layout Standard
For H3K4me2, plotting the average bin abundances for each cluster reveals
 a simple pattern (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:H3K4me2-neighborhood-clusters"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

): Cluster 5 represents a completely flat promoter coverage profile, likely
 consisting of genes with no H3K4me2 methylation in the promoter.
 All the other clusters represent a continuum of peak positions relative
 to the TSS.
 In order from must upstream to most downstream, they are Clusters 6, 4,
 3, 1, and 2.
 There do not appear to be any clusters representing coverage patterns other
 than lone peaks, such as coverage troughs or double peaks.
 Next, all promoters were plotted in a PCA plot based on the same relative
 bin abundance data, and colored based on cluster membership (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:H3K4me2-neighborhood-pca"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The PCA plot shows Cluster 5 (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no peak
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cluster) at the center, with the other clusters arranged in a counter-clockwise
 arc around it in the order noted above, from most upstream peak to most
 downstream.
 Notably, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clusters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 form a single large 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cloud
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with no apparent separation between them, further supporting the conclusion
 that these clusters represent an arbitrary partitioning of a continuous
 distribution of promoter coverage landscapes.
 While the clusters are a useful abstraction that aids in visualization,
 they are ultimately not an accurate representation of the data.
 A better representation might be something like a polar coordinate system
 with the origin at the center of Cluster 5, where the radius represents
 the peak height above the background and the angle represents the peak's
 position upstream or downstream of the TSS.
 The continuous nature of the distribution also explains why different values
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 led to similar conclusions.

To investigate the association between relative peak position and gene expressio
n, we plotted the Naive Day 0 expression for the genes in each cluster (Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:H3K4me2-neighborhood-expression"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Most genes in Cluster 5, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no peak
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cluster, have low expression values.
 Taking this as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

baseline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 distribution when no H3K4me2 methylation is present, we can compare the
 other clusters' distributions to determine which peak positions are associated
 with elevated expression.
 As might be expected, the 3 clusters representing peaks closest to the
 TSS, Clusters 1, 3, and 4, show the highest average expression distributions.
 Specifically, these clusters all have their highest ChIP-seq abundance
 within 1kb of the TSS, consistent with the previously determined promoter
 radius.
 In contrast, cluster 6, which represents peaks several kb upstream of the
 TSS, shows a slightly higher average expression than baseline, while Cluster
 2, which represents peaks several kb downstream, doesn't appear to show
 any appreciable difference.
 Interestingly, the cluster with the highest average expression is Cluster
 1, which represents peaks about 1 kb downstream of the TSS, rather than
 Cluster 3, which represents peaks centered directly at the TSS.
 This suggests that conceptualizing the promoter as a region centered on
 the TSS with a certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

radius
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 may be an oversimplification ‚Äì a peak that is a specific distance from
 the TSS may have a different degree of influence depending on whether it
 is upstream or downstream of the TSS.

Unlike both H3K4 marks, whose main patterns of variation appear directly
 related to the size and position of a single peak within the promoter,
 the patterns of H3K27me3 methylation in promoters are more complex (Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:H3K27me3-neighborhood"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 Once again looking at the relative coverage in a 500-bp wide bins in a
 5kb radius around each TSS, promoters were clustered based on the normalized
 relative coverage values in each bin using 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-means clustering with 
\begin_inset Formula $K=6$
\end_inset

 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

).
 This time, 3 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

axes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of variation can be observed, each represented by 2 clusters with opposing
 patterns.
 The first axis is greater upstream coverage (Cluster 1) vs.
 greater downstream coverage (Cluster 3); the second axis is the coverage
 at the TSS itself: peak (Cluster 4) or trough (Cluster 2); lastly, the
 third axis represents a trough upstream of the TSS (Cluster 5) vs.
 downstream of the TSS (Cluster 6).
 Referring to these opposing pairs of clusters as axes of variation is justified
, because they correspond precisely to the first 3 principal components
 in the PCA plot of the relative coverage values (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:H3K27me3-neighborhood-pca"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 The PCA plot reveals that as in the case of H3K4me2, all the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clusters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are really just sections of a single connected cloud rather than discrete
 clusters.
 The cloud is approximately ellipsoid-shaped, with each PC being an axis
 of the ellipse, and each cluster consisting of a pyrimidal section of the
 ellipsoid.

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:H3K27me3-neighborhood-expression"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we can see that Clusters 1 and 2 are the only clusters with higher gene
 expression than the others.
 For Cluster 2, this is expected, since this cluster represents genes with
 depletion of H3K27me3 near the promoter.
 Hence, elevated expression in cluster 2 is consistent with the conventional
 view of H3K27me3 as a deactivating mark.
 However, Cluster 1, the cluster with the most elevated gene expression,
 represents genes with elevated coverage upstream of the TSS, or equivalently,
 decreased coverage downstream, inside the gene body.
 The opposite pattern, in which H3K27me3 is more abundant within the gene
 body and less abundance in the upstream promoter region, does not show
 any elevation in gene expression.
 As with H3K4me2, this shows that the location of H3K27 trimethylation relative
 to the TSS is potentially an important factor beyond simple proximity.

 shows that H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 are all enriched near promoters,
 relative to the rest of the genome, consistent with their conventionally
 understood role in regulating gene transcription.
 Interestingly, the radius within this enrichment occurs is not the same
 for each histone mark.
 H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 are enriched within a 1

kb radius, while H3K27me3 is enriched within 2.5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

kb.
 Notably, the determined promoter radius was consistent across all experimental
 conditions, varying only between different histone marks.
 This suggests that the conventional

\end_inset

 approach of defining a single promoter region for each gene (or each TSS)
 and using that same promoter region for analyzing all types of genomic
 data within an experiment may not be appropriate, and a better approach
 may be to use a separate promoter radius for each kind of data, with each
 radius being derived from the data itself.
 Furthermore, the apparent assymetry of upstream and downstream promoter
 histone modification with respect to gene expression, seen in Figures

 At a minimum, nearby enrichment of peaks should be evaluated separately

 show that the determined promoter radius of 1

kb is approximately consistent with the distance from the TSS at which enrichmen
t of H3K4 methylationis correlates with increased expression, showing that
 this radius, which was determined by a simple analysis of measuring the
 distance from each TSS to the nearest peak, also has functional significance.
 For H3K27me3, the correlation between histone modification near the promoter
 and gene expression is more complex, involving non-peak variations such
 as troughs in coverage at the TSS and asymmetric coverage upstream and
 downstream, so it is difficult in this case to evaluate whether the 2.5
\begin_inset space ~

kb radius determined from TSS-to-peak distances is functionally significant.
 However, the two patterns of coverage associated with elevated expression
 levels both have interesting features within this radius.

We have observed that all 3 histone marks and the gene expression data all
 exhibit evidence of convergence in abundance between naive and memory cells
 by day 14 after activation (Figure

 The MOFA latent factor scatter plots (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) show that this pattern of convergence is captured in latent factor 5.
 Like all the latent factors in this plot, this factor explains a substantial
 portion of the variance in all 4 data sets, indicating a coordinated pattern
 of variation shared across all histone marks and gene expression.
 This, of course, is consistent with the expectation that any naive CD4
 T-cells remaining at day 14 should have differentiated into memory cells
 by that time, and should therefore have a genomic state similar to memory
 cells.
 This convergence is evidence that these histone marks all play an important
 role in the naive-to-memory differentiation process.
 A histone mark that was not involved in naive-to-memory differentiation
 would not be expected to converge in this way after activation.

 This agrees with the model proposed by Sarah Lamere based on an prior analysis

 This model was developed without the benefit of the PCoA plots in Figure

 This shows that proper batch correction assists in extracting meaningful
 patterns in the data while eliminating systematic sources of irrelevant
 variation in the data, allowing simple automated procedures like PCoA to
 reveal interesting behaviors in the data that were previously only detectable
 by a detailed manual analysis.
\end_layout

While the ideal comparison to demonstrate this convergence would be naive
 cells at day 14 to memory cells at day 0, this is not feasible in this
 experimental system, since neither naive nor memory cells are able to fully

 days 0 and 14 for either naive or memory cells in Figure

Positional
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When looking at patterns in the relative coverage of each histone mark near
 the TSS of each gene, several interesting patterns were apparent.
 For H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, the pattern was straightforward: the consistent
 pattern across all promoters was a single peak a few kb wide, with the
 main axis of variation being the position of this peak relative to the
 TSS (Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 There were no obvious 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 positions, but rather a continuous distribution of relative positions ranging
 all across the promoter region.
 The association with gene expression was also straightforward: peaks closer
 to the TSS were more strongly associated with elevated gene expression.
 Coverage downstream of the TSS appears to be more strongly associated with
 elevated expression than coverage the same distance upstream, indicating
 that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

effective promoter region
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 may be centered downstream of the TSS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relative promoter coverage for H3K27me3 had a more complex pattern,
 with two specific patterns of promoter coverage associated with elevated
 expression: a sharp depletion of H3K27me3 around the TSS relative to the
 surrounding area, and a depletion of H3K27me3 downstream of the TSS relative
 to upstream (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:H3K27me3-neighborhood"
plural "false"

 A previous study found that H3K27me3 depletion within the gene body was
 associated with elevated gene expression in 4 different cell types in mice
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 This is consistent with the second pattern described here.
 This study also reported that a spike in coverage at the TSS was associated
 with 
\emph on
lower

 expression, which is indirectly consistent with the first pattern described
 here, in the sense that it associates lower H3K27me3 levels near the TSS

 and the blacklist of regions to be excluded from ChIP-seq analysis.
 Each step declares its inputs and outputs, and Snakemake uses these to
 determine the dependencies between steps.
 Each step is marked as depending on all the steps whose outputs match its
 inputs, generating the workflow graph in Figure

 so that each step is executed only after all of the steps it depends on
 have completed, thereby automating the entire workflow from start to finish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to simply making it easier to organize the steps in the analysis,
 structuring the analysis as a workflow allowed for some analysis strategies
 that would not have been practical otherwise.
 For example, 5 different RNA-seq quantification methods were tested against
 two different reference transcriptome annotations for a total of 10 different
 quantifications of the same RNA-seq data.
 These were then compared against each other in the exploratory data analysis
 step, to determine that the results were not very sensitive to either the
 choice of quantification method or the choice of annotation.
 This was possible with a single script for the exploratory data analysis,
 because Snakemake was able to automate running this script for every combinatio
n of method and reference.
 In a similar manner, two different peak calling methods were tested against
 each other, and in this case it was determined that SICER was unambiguously
 superior to MACS for all histone marks studied.
 By enabling these types of comparisons, structuring the analysis as an
 automated workflow allowed important analysis decisions to be made in a
 data-driven way, by running every reasonable option through the downstream
 steps, seeing the consequences of choosing each option, and deciding accordingl
y.

Microarrays, bead arrays, and similar assays produce raw data in the form
 of fluorescence intensity measurements, with the each intensity measurement
 proportional to the abundance of some fluorescently-labelled target DNA
 or RNA sequence that base pairs to a specific probe sequence.
 However, these measurements for each probe are also affected my many technical
 confounding factors, such as the concentration of target material, strength
 of off-target binding, and the sensitivity of the imaging sensor.
 Some array designs also use multiple probe sequences for each target.
 Hence, extensive pre-processing of array data is necessary to normalize
 out the effects of these technical factors and summarize the information
 from multiple probes to arrive at a single usable estimate of abundance
 or other relevant quantity, such as a ratio of two abundances, for each
 target.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The choice of pre-processing algorithms used in the analysis of an array
 data set can have a large effect on the results of that analysis.
 However, despite their importance, these steps are often neglected or rushed
 in order to get to the more scientifically interesting analysis steps involving
 the actual biology of the system under study.
 Hence, it is often possible to achieve substantial gains in statistical
 power, model goodness-of-fit, or other relevant performance measures, by
 checking the assumptions made by each preprocessing step and choosing specific
 normalization methods tailored to the specific goals of the current analysis.

Clinical diagnostic applications for microarrays require single-channel
 normalization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the cost of performing microarray assays falls, there is increasing interest
 in using genomic assays for diagnostic purposes, such as distinguishing
 healthy transplants (TX) from transplants undergoing acute rejection (AR)
 or acute dysfunction with no rejection (ADNR).
 However, the the standard normalization algorithm used for microarray data,
 Robust Multi-chip Average (RMA) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Irizarry2003a"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, is not applicable in a clinical setting.
 Two of the steps in RMA, quantile normalization and probe summarization
 by median polish, depend on every array in the data set being normalized.
 This means that adding or removing any arrays from a data set changes the
 normalized values for all arrays, and data sets that have been normalized
 separately cannot be compared to each other.
 Hence, when using RMA, any arrays to be analyzed together must also be
 normalized together, and the set of arrays included in the data set must
 be held constant throughout an analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These limitations present serious impediments to the use of arrays as a
 diagnostic tool.
 When training a classifier, the samples to be classified must not be involved
 in any step of the training process, lest their inclusion bias the training
 process.
 Once a classifier is deployed in a clinical setting, the samples to be
 classified will not even 
\emph on
exist
\emph default
 at the time of training, so including them would be impossible even if
 it were statistically justifiable.
 Therefore, any machine learning application for microarrays demands that
 the normalized expression values computed for an array must depend only
 on information contained within that array.
 This would ensure that each array's normalization is independent of every
 other array, and that arrays normalized separately can still be compared
 to each other without bias.
 Such a normalization is commonly referred to as

Frozen RMA (fRMA) addresses these concerns by replacing the quantile normalizati
on and median polish with alternatives that do not introduce inter-array
 dependence, allowing each array to be normalized independently of all others
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McCall2010"

\end_inset

.
 Quantile normalization is performed against a pre-generated set of quantiles
 learned from a collection of 850 publically available arrays sampled from
 a wide variety of tissues in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
 Each array's probe intensity distribution is normalized against these pre-gener
ated quantiles.
 The median polish step is replaced with a robust weighted average of probe
 intensities, using inverse variance weights learned from the same public
 GEO data.
 The result is a normalization that satisfies the requirements mentioned
 above: each array is normalized independently of all others, and any two
 normalized arrays can be compared directly to each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One important limitation of fRMA is that it requires a separate reference
 data set from which to learn the parameters (reference quantiles and probe
 weights) that will be used to normalize each array.
 These parameters are specific to a given array platform, and pre-generated
 parameters are only provided for the most common platforms, such as Affymetrix
 hgu133plus2.
 For a less common platform, such as hthgu133pluspm, is is necessary to
 learn custom parameters from in-house data before fRMA can be used to normalize
 samples on that platform

 SCAN is truly single-channel in that it does not require a set of normalization
 paramters estimated from an external set of reference samples like fRMA
 does.

Heteroskedasticity must be accounted for in methylation array data 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DNA methylation arrays are a relatively new kind of assay that uses microarrays
 to measure the degree of methylation on cytosines in specific regions arrayed
 across the genome.
 First, bisulfite treatment converts all unmethylated cytosines to uracil
 (which then become thymine after amplication) while leaving methylated
 cytosines unaffected.
 Then, each target region is interrogated with two probes: one binds to
 the original genomic sequence and interrogates the level of methylated
 DNA, and the other binds to the same sequence with all cytosines replaced
 by thymidines and interrogates the level of unmethylated DNA.

values are conceptually easy to interpret, but the constrained range makes
 them unsuitable for linear modeling, and their error distributions are
 highly non-normal, which also frustrates linear modeling.
 M-values, interpreted as the log ratio of methylated to unmethylated copies,
 are computed by mapping the beta values from 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

 onto 
\begin_inset Formula $(-\infty,+\infty)$
\end_inset

 using a sigmoid curve (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 This transformation results in values with better statistical perperties:
 the unconstrained range is suitable for linear modeling, and the error
 distributions are more normal.
 Hence, most linear modeling and other statistical testing on methylation
 arrays is performed using M-values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the steep slope of the sigmoid transformation near 0 and 1 tends
 to over-exaggerate small differences in Œ≤ values near those extremes, which
 in turn amplifies the error in those values, leading to a U-shaped trend
 in the mean-variance curve: extreme values have higher variances than values
 near the middle.
 This mean-variance dependency must be accounted for when fitting the linear
 model for differential methylation, or else the variance will be systematically
 overestimated for probes with moderate M-values and underestimated for
 probes with extreme M-values.
 This is particularly undesirable for methylation data because the intermediate
 M-values are the ones of most interest, since they are more likely to represent
 areas of varying methylation, whereas extreme M-values typically represent
 complete methylation or complete lack of methylation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
RNA-seq read count data are also known to show heteroskedasticity, and the
 voom method was introduced for modeling this heteroskedasticity by estimating
 the mean-variance trend in the data and using this trend to assign precision
 weights to each observation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Law2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 While methylation array data are not derived from counts and have a very
 different mean-variance relationship from that of typical RNA-seq data,
 the voom method makes no specific assumptions on the shape of the mean-variance
 relationship ‚Äì it only assumes that the relationship can be modeled as
 a smooth curve.
 Hence, the method is sufficiently general to model the mean-variance relationsh
ip in methylation array data.
 However, the standard implementation of voom assumes that the input is
 given in raw read counts, and it must be adapted to run on methylation
 M-values.

To evaluate the effect of each normalization on classifier performance,
 the same classifier training and validation procedure was used after each
 normalization method.
 The PAM package was used to train a nearest shrunken centroid classifier
 on the training set and select the appropriate threshold for centroid shrinking.
 Then the trained classifier was used to predict the class probabilities
 of each validation sample.
 From these class probabilities, ROC curves and area-under-curve (AUC) values
 were generated 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Turck2011"

\end_inset

.
 Each normalization was tested on two different sets of training and validation
 samples.
 For internal validation, the 115 TX and AR arrays in the internal set were
 split at random into two equal sized sets, one for training and one for
 validation, each containing the same numbers of TX and AR samples as the
 other set.
 For external validation, the full set of 115 TX and AR samples were used
 as a training set, and the 75 external TX and AR samples were used as the
 validation set.
 Thus, 2 ROC curves and AUC values were generated for each normalization
 method: one internal and one external.
 Because the external validation set contains no ADNR samples, only classificati
on of TX and AR samples was considered.
 The ADNR samples were included during normalization but excluded from all
 classifier training and validation.
 This ensures that the performance on internal and external validation sets
 is directly comparable, since both are performing the same task: distinguising
 TX from AR.

 (GRSN) were tested

 Post-processing with GRSN does not turn RMA or dChip into single-channel
 methods, but it may help mitigate batch effects and is therefore useful
 as a benchmark.
 Lastly, the two single-channel normalization methods, fRMA and SCAN, were
 tested

 When evaluting internal validation performance, only the 157 internal samples
 were normalized; when evaluating external validation performance, all 157
 internal samples and 75 external samples were normalized together.

\begin_layout Standard
For demonstrating the problem with separate normalization of training and
 validation data, one additional normalization was performed: the internal
 and external sets were each normalized separately using RMA, and the normalized
 data for each set were combined into a single set with no further attempts
 at normalizing between the two sets.
 The represents approximately how RMA would have to be used in a clinical
 setting, where the samples to be classified are not available at the time
 the classifier is trained.

Generating custom fRMA vectors for hthgu133pluspm array platform

In order to enable fRMA normalization for the hthgu133pluspm array platform,
 custom fRMA normalization vectors were trained using the frmaTools package
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McCall2011"

\end_inset

.
 Separate vectors were created for two types of samples: kidney graft biopsy
 samples and blood samples from graft recipients.
 For training, a 341 kidney biopsy samples from 2 data sets and 965 blood
 samples from 5 data sets were used as the reference set.
 Arrays were groups into batches based on unique combinations of sample
 type (blood or biopsy), diagnosis (TX, AR, etc.), data set, and scan date.
 Thus, each batch represents arrays of the same kind that were run together
 on the same day.
 For estimating the probe inverse variance weights, frmaTools requires equal-siz
ed batches, which means a batch size must be chosen, and then batches smaller
 than that size must be ignored, while batches larger than the chosen size
 must be downsampled.
 This downsampling is performed randomly, so the sampling process is repeated
 5 times and the resulting normalizations are compared to each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To evaluate the consistency of the generated normalization vectors, the
 5 fRMA vector sets generated from 5 random batch samplings were each used
 to normalize the same 20 randomly selected samples from each tissue.
 Then the normalized expression values for each probe on each array were
 compared across all normalizations.
 Each fRMA normalization was also compared against the normalized expression
 values obtained by normalizing the same 20 samples with ordinary RMA.

 no rejection (ADNR), and chronic allograpft nephropathy (CAN).
 The data consisted of 33 TX, 9 AR, 8 ADNR, and 28 CAN samples.
 The uneven group sizes are a result of taking the biopsy samples before
 the eventual fate of the transplant was known.

 Each time weights were used, they were estimated once before estimating
 the random effect correlation value, and then the weights were re-estimated
 taking the random effect into account.

Classifier probabilities on validation samples when normalized with RMA
 together vs.
 separately.
 
\series default
The PAM classifier algorithm was trained on the training set of arrays to
 distinguish AR from TX and then used to assign class probabilities to the
 validation set.
 The process was performed after normalizing all samples together and after
 normalizing the training and test sets separately, and the class probabilities
 assigned to each sample in the validation set were plotted against each
 other (PP(AR), posterior probability of being AR).
 The color of each point indicates the true classification of that sample.

\begin_layout Standard
To demonstrate the problem with non-single-channel normalization methods,
 we considered the problem of training a classifier to distinguish TX from
 AR using the samples from the internal set as training data, evaluating
 performance on the external set.
 First, training and evaluation were performed after normalizing all array
 samples together as a single set using RMA, and second, the internal samples
 were normalized separately from the external samples and the training and
 evaluation were repeated.
 For each sample in the validation set, the classifier probabilities from
 both classifiers were plotted against each other (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Classifier-probabilities-RMA"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 As expected, separate normalization biases the classifier probabilities,
 resulting in several misclassifications.
 In this case, the bias from separate normalization causes the classifier
 to assign a lower probability of AR to every sample.

 Among the non-single-channel normalizations, dChip outperformed RMA, while
 GRSN reduced the AUC values for both dChip and RMA.
 Both single-channel methods, fRMA and SCAN, slightly outperformed RMA,
 with fRMA ahead of SCAN.
 However, the difference between RMA and fRMA is still quite small.
 Figure

 With or without GRSN, RMA shows its dominance over dChip in this more challengi
ng test.
 Unlike in the internal validation, GRSN actually improves the classifier
 performance for RMA, although it does not for dChip.
 Once again, both single-channel methods perform about on par with RMA,
 with fRMA performing slightly better and SCAN performing a bit worse.

In order to enable use of fRMA to normalize hthgu133pluspm, a custom set
 of fRMA vectors was created.
 First, an appropriate batch size was chosen by looking at the number of
 batches and number of samples included as a function of batch size (Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:frmatools-batch-size"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 For a given batch size, all batches with fewer samples that the chosen
 size must be ignored during training, while larger batches must be randomly
 downsampled to the chosen size.
 Hence, the number of samples included for a given batch size equals the
 batch size times the number of batches with at least that many samples.
 From Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:batch-size-samples"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, it is apparent that that a batch size of 8 maximizes the number of samples
 included in training.
 Increasing the batch size beyond this causes too many smaller batches to
 be excluded, reducing the total number of samples for both tissue types.
 However, a batch size of 8 is not necessarily optimal.
 The article introducing frmaTools concluded that it was highly advantageous
 to use a smaller batch size in order to include more batches, even at the
 expense of including fewer total samples in training 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 To strike an appropriate balance between more batches and more samples,
 a batch size of 5 was chosen.
 For both blood and biopsy samples, this increased the number of batches
 included by 10, with only a modest reduction in the number of samples compared
 to a batch size of 8.
 With a batch size of 5, 26 batches of biopsy samples and 46 batches of
 blood samples were available.

Since fRMA training requires equal-size batches, larger batches are downsampled
 randomly.
 This introduces a nondeterministic step in the generation of normalization
 vectors.
 To show that this randomness does not substantially change the outcome,
 the random downsampling and subsequent vector learning was repeated 5 times,
 with a different random seed each time.
 20 samples were selected at random as a test set and normalized with each
 of the 5 sets of fRMA normalization vectors as well as ordinary RMA, and
 the normalized expression values were compared across normalizations.
 Figure

 shows a summary of these comparisons for biopsy samples.
 Comparing RMA to each of the 5 fRMA normalizations, the distribution of
 log ratios is somewhat wide, indicating that the normalizations disagree
 on the expression values of a fair number of probe sets.
 In contrast, comparisons of fRMA against fRMA, the vast mojority of probe
 sets have very small log ratios, indicating a very high agreement between
 the normalized values generated by the two normalizations.
 This shows that the fRMA normalization's behavior is not very sensitive
 to the random downsampling of larger batches during training.

 This MA plot shows that not only is there a wide distribution of M-values,
 but the trend of M-values is dependent on the average normalized intensity.
 This is expected, since the overall trend represents the differences in
 the quantile normalization step.
 When running RMA, only the quantiles for these specific 20 arrays are used,
 while for fRMA the quantile distribution is taking from all arrays used
 in training.

 the normalized expression values between normalizations for all probe sets

 Once again, there is a wider distribution of log ratios between RMA-normalized
 values and fRMA-normalized, and a much tighter distribution when comparing
 different fRMA normalizations to each other, indicating that the fRMA training
 process is robust to random batch downsampling for the blood samples as
 well.

Figure

\end_inset

 shows the relationship between the mean M-value and the standard deviation
 calculated for each probe in the methylation array data set.
 A few features of the data are apparent.
 First, the data are very strongly bimodal, with peaks in the density around
 M-values of +4 and -4.
 These modes correspond to methylation sites that are nearly 100% methylated
 and nearly 100% unmethylated, respectively.
 The strong bomodality indicates that a majority of probes interrogate sites
 that fall into one of these two categories.
 The points in between these modes represent sites that are either partially
 methylated in many samples, or are fully methylated in some samples and
 fully unmethylated in other samples, or some combination.
 The next visible feature of the data is the W-shaped variance trend.
 The upticks in the variance trend on either side are expected, based on
 the sigmoid transformation exaggerating small differences at extreme M-values
 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Sigmoid-beta-m-mapping"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 However, the uptick in the center is interesting: it indicates that sites
 that are not constitutitively methylated or unmethylated have a higher
 variance.
 This could be a genuine biological effect, or it could be spurious noise
 that is only observable at sites with varying methylation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:meanvar-sva-aw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we see the mean-variance trend for the same methylation array data, this
 time with surrogate variables and sample quality weights estimated from
 the data and included in the model.
 As expected, the overall average variance is smaller, since the surrogate
 variables account for some of the variance.
 In addition, the uptick in variance in the middle of the M-value range
 has disappeared, turning the W shape into a wide U shape.
 This indicates that the excess variance in the probes with intermediate
 M-values was explained by systematic variations not correlated with known
 covariates, and these variations were modeled by the surrogate variables.
 The result is a nearly flat variance trend for the entire intermediate
 M-value range from about -3 to +3.
 Note that this corresponds closely to the range within which the M-value
 transformation shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Sigmoid-beta-m-mapping"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is nearly linear.
 In contrast, the excess variance at the extremes (greater than +3 and less
 than -3) was not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

absorbed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by the surrogate variables and remains in the plot, indicating that this
 variation has no systematic component: probes with extreme M-values are
 uniformly more variable across all samples, as expected.

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:meanvar-sva-voomaw"

 shows the mean-variance trend after fitting the model with the observation
 weights assigned by voom based on the mean-variance trend shown in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:meanvar-sva-aw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 As expected, the weights exactly counteract the trend in the data, resulting
 in a nearly flat trend centered vertically at 1 (i.e.
 0 on the log scale).
 This shows that the observations with extreme M-values have been appropriately
 down-weighted to account for the fact that the noise in those observations
 has been amplified by the non-linear M-value transformation.
 In turn, this gives relatively more weight to observervations in the middle
 region, which are more likely to correspond to probes measuring interesting
 biology (not constitutively methylated or unmethylated).

 Note that this does not identify which null hypotheses should be rejected

 which probes are significant); it only estimates the true number of such
 probes.
 Once again, analyses B and C result it much larger estimates for the number
 of differentially methylated probes.
 In this case, analysis C, the only analysis that includes voom, estimates
 the largest number of differentially methylated probes for all 3 contrasts.
 If the assumptions of all the methods employed hold, then this represents
 a gain in statistical power over the simpler analysis A.

 The distributions for analysis A all have a dip in density near zero, which

 The histograms for analyses B and C are more well-behaved, with a uniform

 which the null hypotheses is true (no differential methylation), and a
 zero-biased component representing the probes for which the null hypothesis
 is false (differentially methylated).
 These histograms do not indicate any major issues with the model fit.

fRMA achieves clinically applicable normalization without sacrificing classifica

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Classifier-probabilities-RMA"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, improper normalization, particularly separate normalization of training
 and test samples, leads to unwanted biases in classification.
 In a controlled experimental context, it is always possible to correct
 this issue by normalizing all experimental samples together.
 However, because it is not feasible to normalize all samples together in
 a clinical context, a single-channel normalization is required is required.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The major concern in using a single-channel normalization is that non-single-cha
nnel methods can share information between arrays to improve the normalization,
 and single-channel methods risk sacrificing the gains in normalization
 accuracy that come from this information sharing.
 In the case of RMA, this information sharing is accomplished through quantile
 normalization and median polish steps.
 The need for information sharing in quantile normalization can easily be
 removed by learning a fixed set of quantiles from external data and normalizing
 each array to these fixed quantiles, instead of the quantiles of the data
 itself.
 As long as the fixed quantiles are reasonable, the result will be similar
 to standard RMA.
 However, there is no analogous way to eliminate cross-array information
 sharing in the median polish step, so fRMA replaces this with a weighted
 average of probes on each array, with the weights learned from external
 data.
 This step of fRMA has the greatest potential to diverge from RMA un undesirable
 ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, when run on real data, fRMA performed at least as well as RMA in
 both the internal validation and external validation tests.
 This shows that fRMA can be used to normalize individual clinical samples
 in a class prediction context without sacrificing the classifier performance
 that would be obtained by using the more well-established RMA for normalization.
 The other single-channel normalization method considered, SCAN, showed
 some loss of AUC in the external validation test.
 Based on these results, fRMA is the preferred normalization for clinical
 samples in a class prediction context.

The published fRMA normalization vectors for the hgu133plus2 platform were
 generated from a set of about 850 samples chosen from a wide range of tissues,
 which the authors determined was sufficient to generate a robust set of
 normalization vectors that could be applied across all tissues 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McCall2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Since we only had hthgu133pluspm for 2 tissues of interest, our needs were
 more modest.
 Even using only 130 samples in 26 batches of 5 samples each for kidney
 biopsies, we were able to train a robust set of fRMA normalization vectors
 that were not meaningfully affected by the random selection of 5 samples
 from each batch.
 As expected, the training process was just as robust for the blood samples
 with 230 samples in 46 batches of 5 samples each.
 Because these vectors were each generated using training samples from a
 single tissue, they are not suitable for general use, unlike the vectors
 provided with fRMA itself.
 They are purpose-built for normalizing a specific type of sample on a specific
 platform.
 This is a mostly acceptable limitation in the context of developing a machine
 learning classifier for diagnosing a disease based on samples of a specific
 tissue.

Methylation array data can be successfully analyzed using existing techniques,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both analysis strategies B and C both yield a reasonable analysis, with
 a mean-variance trend that matches the expected behavior for the non-linear
 M-value transformation (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:meanvar-sva-aw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) and well-behaved p-value distributions (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:meth-p-value-histograms"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 These two analyses also yield similar numbers of significant probes (Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:methyl-num-signif"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) and similar estimates of the number of differentially methylated probes
 (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:methyl-est-nonnull"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The main difference between these two analyses is the method used to account
 for the mean-variance trend.
 In analysis B, the trend is estimated and applied at the probe level: each
 probe's estimated variance is squeezed toward the trend using an empirical
 Bayes procedure (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:meanvar-sva-aw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 In analysis C, the trend is still estimated at the probe level, but instead
 of estimating a single variance value shared across all observations for
 a given probe, the voom method computes an initial estiamte of the variance
 for each observation individually based on where its model-fitted M-value
 falls on the trend line and then assigns inverse-variance weights to model
 the difference in variance between observations.
 An overall variance is still estimated for each probe using the same empirical
 Bayes method, but now the residual trend is flat (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:meanvar-sva-voomaw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), indicating that the mean-variance trend is adequately modeled by scaling
 the estimated variance for each observation using the weights computed
 by voom.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difference between the standard empirical Bayes trended variance modeling
 (analysis B) and voom (analysis C) is analogous to the difference between
 a t-test with equal variance and a t-test with unequal variance, except
 that the unequal group variances used in the latter test are estimated
 based on the mean-variance trend from all the probes rather than the data
 for the specific probe being tested, thus stabilizing the group variance
 estimates by sharing information between probes.
 Allowing voom to model the variance using observation weights in this manner
 allows the linear model fit to concentrate statistical power where it will
 do the most good.
 For example, if a particular probe's M-values are always at the extreme
 of the M-value range (e.g.
 less than -4) for ADNR samples, but the M-values for that probe in TX and
 CAN samples are within the flat region of the mean-variance trend (between
 -3 and +3), voom is able to down-weight the contribution of the high-variance
 M-values from the ADNR samples in order to gain more statistical power
 while testing for differential methylation between TX and CAN.
 In contrast, modeling the mean-variance trend only at the probe level would
 combine the high-variance ADNR samples and lower-variance samples from
 other conditions and estimate an intermediate variance for this probe.
 In practice, analysis B shows that this approach is adequate, but the voom
 approach in analysis C is at least as good on all model fit criteria and
 yields a larger estimate for the number of differentially methylated genes,
 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 it matches up better with the theoretical

\begin_layout Standard
The significant association of diebetes diagnosis with sample quality is
 interesting.
 The samples with Type 2 diabetes tended to have more variation, averaged
 across all probes, than those with Type 1 diabetes.
 This is consistent with the consensus that type 2 disbetes and the associated
 metabolic syndrome represent a broad dysregulation of the body's endocrine
 signalling related to metabolism [citation needed].
 This dysregulation could easily manifest as a greater degree of variation
 in the DNA methylation patterns of affected tissues.
 In contrast, Type 1 disbetes has a more specific cause and effect, so a
 less variable methylation signature is expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This preliminary anlaysis suggests that some degree of differential methylation
 exists between TX and each of the three types of transplant disfunction
 studied.
 Hence, it may be feasible to train a classifier to diagnose transplant
 disfunction from DNA methylation array data.
 However, the major importance of both SVA and sample quality weighting
 for proper modeling of this data poses significant challenges for any attempt
 at a machine learning on data of similar quality.
 While these are easily used in a modeling context with full sample information,
 neither of these methods is directly applicable in a machine learning context,
 where the diagnosis is not known ahead of time.
 If a machine learning approach for methylation-based diagnosis is to be
 pursued, it will either require machine-learning-friendly methods to address
 the same systematic trends in the data that SVA and sample quality weighting
 address, or it will require higher quality data with substantially less
 systematic perturbation of the data.

Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Primate blood contains high concentrations of globin messenger RNA.
 Globin reduction is a standard technique used to improve the expression
 results obtained by DNA microarrays on RNA from blood samples.
 However, with whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) quickly replacing
 microarrays for many applications, the impact of globin reduction for RNA-seq
 has not been previously studied.
 Moreover, no off-the-shelf kits are available for globin reduction in nonhuman
 primates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we report a protocol for RNA-seq in primate blood samples that uses
 complimentary oligonucleotides to block reverse transcription of the alpha
 and beta globin genes.
 In test samples from cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), this globin
 blocking protocol approximately doubles the yield of informative (non-globin)
 reads by greatly reducing the fraction of globin reads, while also improving
 the consistency in sequencing depth between samples.
 The increased yield enables detection of about 2000 more genes, significantly
 increases the correlation in measured gene expression levels between samples,
 and increases the sensitivity of differential gene expression tests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These results show that globin blocking significantly improves the cost-effectiv
eness of mRNA sequencing in primate blood samples by doubling the yield
 of useful reads, allowing detection of more genes, and improving the precision
 of gene expression measurements.
 Based on these results, a globin reducing or blocking protocol is recommended
 for all RNA-seq studies of primate blood samples.

 The advantages are even greater for study of model organisms with no well-estab
lished array platforms available, such as the cynomolgus monkey (Macaca
 fascicularis).
 High fractions of globin mRNA are naturally present in mammalian peripheral
 blood samples (up to 70% of total mRNA) and these are known to interfere
 with the results of array-based expression profiling

 In the present report, we evaluated globin reduction using custom blocking
 oligonucleotides for deep RNA-seq of peripheral blood samples from a nonhuman
 primate, cynomolgus monkey, using the Illumina technology platform.
 We demonstrate that globin reduction significantly improves the cost-effectiven
ess of RNA-seq in blood samples.
 Thus, our protocol offers a significant advantage to any investigator planning
 to use RNA-seq for gene expression profiling of nonhuman primate blood
 samples.
 Our method can be generally applied to any species by designing complementary
 oligonucleotide blocking probes to the globin gene sequences of that species.
 Indeed, any highly expressed but biologically uninformative transcripts
 can also be blocked to further increase sequencing efficiency and value

\begin_layout Standard
All research reported here was done under IACUC-approved protocols at the
 University of Miami and complied with all applicable federal and state
 regulations and ethical principles for nonhuman primate research.
 Blood draws occurred between 16 April 2012 and 18 June 2015.
 The experimental system involved intrahepatic pancreatic islet transplantation
 into Cynomolgus monkeys with induced diabetes mellitus with or without
 concomitant infusion of mesenchymal stem cells.
 Blood was collected at serial time points before and after transplantation
 into PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PreAnalytiX/Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at the
 precise volume:volume ratio of 2.5 ml whole blood into 6.9 ml of PAX gene
 additive.

 and 2 sites for HBA (the chosen sites were identical in both HBA genes).
 All oligos were purchased from Sigma and were entirely composed of 2‚ÄôO-Me
 bases with a C3 spacer positioned at the 3‚Äô ends to prevent any polymerase

RNA-seq Library Preparation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sequencing libraries were prepared with 200ng total RNA from each sample.
 Polyadenylated mRNA was selected from 200 ng aliquots of cynomologus blood-deri
ved total RNA using Ambion Dynabeads Oligo(dT)25 beads (Invitrogen) following
 manufacturer‚Äôs recommended protocol.
 PolyA selected RNA was then combined with 8 pmol of HBA1/2 (site 1), 8
 pmol of HBA1/2 (site 2), 12 pmol of HBB (site 1) and 12 pmol of HBB (site
 2) oligonucleotides.
 In addition, 20 pmol of RT primer containing a portion of the Illumina
 adapter sequence (B-oligo-dTV: GAGTTCCTTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTV)
 and 4 ¬µL of 5X First Strand buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl,
 15mM MgCl2) were added in a total volume of 15 ¬µL.
 The RNA was fragmented by heating this cocktail for 3 minutes at 95¬∞C and
 then placed on ice.
 This was followed by the addition of 2 ¬µL 0.1 M DTT, 1 ¬µL RNaseOUT, 1 ¬µL
 10mM dNTPs 10% biotin-16 aminoallyl-2‚Äô- dUTP and 10% biotin-16 aminoallyl-2‚Äô-
 dCTP (TriLink Biotech, San Diego, CA), 1 ¬µL Superscript II (200U/ ¬µL, Thermo-Fi
sher).
 A second ‚Äúunblocked‚Äù library was prepared in the same way for each sample
 but replacing the blocking oligos with an equivalent volume of water.
 The reaction was carried out at 25¬∞C for 15 minutes and 42¬∞C for 40 minutes,
 followed by incubation at 75¬∞C for 10 minutes to inactivate the reverse
 transcriptase.

 The cDNA/RNA hybrid was eluted in 25 ¬µL of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and then
 bound to 25 ¬µL of M280 Magnetic Streptavidin beads washed per recommended
 protocol (Thermo-Fisher).
 After 30 minutes of binding, beads were washed one time in 100 ¬µL 0.1N NaOH
 to denature and remove the bound RNA, followed by two 100 ¬µL washes with
 1X TE buffer.

 A few artifacts in the cynomolgus genome annotation complicated read counting.
 First, no ortholog is annotated for alpha globin in the cynomolgus genome,
 presumably because the human genome has two alpha globin genes with nearly
 identical sequences, making the orthology relationship ambiguous.
 However, two loci in the cynomolgus genome are as ‚Äúhemoglobin subunit alpha-lik
e‚Äù (LOC102136192 and LOC102136846).
 LOC102136192 is annotated as a pseudogene while LOC102136846 is annotated
 as protein-coding.
 Our globin reduction protocol was designed to include blocking of these
 two genes.
 Indeed, these two genes have almost the same read counts in each library
 as the properly-annotated HBB gene and much larger counts than any other
 gene in the unblocked libraries, giving confidence that reads derived from
 the real alpha globin are mapping to both genes.
 Thus, reads from both of these loci were counted as alpha globin reads
 in all further analyses.
 The second artifact is a small, uncharacterized non-coding RNA gene (LOC1021365
91), which overlaps the HBA-like gene (LOC102136192) on the opposite strand.
 If counting is not performed in stranded mode (or if a non-strand-specific
 sequencing protocol is used), many reads mapping to the globin gene will
 be discarded as ambiguous due to their overlap with this ncRNA gene, resulting
 in significant undercounting of globin reads.
 Therefore, stranded sense counts were used for all further analysis in
 the present study to insure that we accurately accounted for globin transcript
 reduction.
 However, we note that stranded reads are not necessary for RNA-seq using
 our protocol in standard practice.

Normalization and Exploratory Data Analysis

Libraries were normalized by computing scaling factors using the edgeR package‚Äôs
 Trimmed Mean of M-values method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Log2 counts per million values (logCPM) were calculated using the cpm function
 in edgeR for individual samples and aveLogCPM function for averages across
 groups of samples, using those functions‚Äô default prior count values to
 avoid taking the logarithm of 0.
 Genes were considered ‚Äúpresent‚Äù if their average normalized logCPM values
 across all libraries were at least -1.
 Normalizing for gene length was unnecessary because the sequencing protocol
 is 3‚Äô-biased and hence the expected read count for each gene is related
 to the transcript‚Äôs copy number but not its length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to assess the effect of blocking on reproducibility, Pearson and
 Spearman correlation coefficients were computed between the logCPM values
 for every pair of libraries within the globin-blocked (GB) and unblocked
 (non-GB) groups, and edgeR's ‚ÄúestimateDisp‚Äù function was used to compute
 negative binomial dispersions separately for the two groups

 To investigate the effects of globin blocking on each gene, an additive
 model was fit to the full data with coefficients for globin blocking and
 SampleID.
 To test the effect of globin blocking on detection of differentially expressed
 genes, the GB samples and non-GB samples were each analyzed independently
 as follows: for each animal with both a pre-transplant and a post-transplant
 time point in the data set, the pre-transplant sample and the earliest
 post-transplant sample were selected, and all others were excluded, yielding
 a pre-/post-transplant pair of samples for each animal (N=7 animals with
 paired samples).
 These samples were analyzed for pre-transplant vs.
 post-transplant differential gene expression while controlling for inter-animal
 variation using an additive model with coefficients for transplant and
 animal ID.
 In all analyses, p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure
 for FDR control

The objective of the present study was to validate a new protocol for deep
 RNA-seq of whole blood drawn into PaxGene tubes from cynomolgus monkeys
 undergoing islet transplantation, with particular focus on minimizing the
 loss of useful sequencing space to uninformative globin reads.
 The details of the analysis with respect to transplant outcomes and the
 impact of mesenchymal stem cell treatment will be reported in a separate
 manuscript (in preparation).
 To focus on the efficacy of our globin blocking protocol, 37 blood samples,
 16 from pre-transplant and 21 from post-transplant time points, were each
 prepped once with and once without globin blocking oligos, and were then
 sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 instrument.
 The number of reads aligning to each gene in the cynomolgus genome was
 counted.
 Table 1 summarizes the distribution of read fractions among the GB and
 non-GB libraries.
 In the libraries with no globin blocking, globin reads made up an average
 of 44.6% of total input reads, while reads assigned to all other genes made
 up an average of 26.3%.
 The remaining reads either aligned to intergenic regions (that include
 long non-coding RNAs) or did not align with any annotated transcripts in
 the current build of the cynomolgus genome.
 In the GB libraries, globin reads made up only 3.48% and reads assigned
 to all other genes increased to 50.4%.
 Thus, globin blocking resulted in a 92.2% reduction in globin reads and
 a 91.6% increase in yield of useful non-globin reads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This reduction is not quite as efficient as the previous analysis showed
 for human samples by DeepSAGE (<0.4% globin reads after globin reduction)
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Nonetheless, this degree of globin reduction is sufficient to nearly double
 the yield of useful reads.
 Thus, globin blocking cuts the required sequencing effort (and costs) to
 achieve a target coverage depth by almost 50%.
 Consistent with this near doubling of yield, the average difference in
 un-normalized logCPM across all genes between the GB libraries and non-GB
 libraries is approximately 1 (mean = 1.01, median = 1.08), an overall 2-fold
 increase.
 Un-normalized values are used here because the TMM normalization correctly
 identifies this 2-fold difference as biologically irrelevant and removes
 it.

Another important aspect is that the standard deviations in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:Fractions-of-reads"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 are uniformly smaller in the GB samples than the non-GB ones, indicating
 much greater consistency of yield.
 This is best seen in the percentage of non-globin reads as a fraction of
 total reads aligned to annotated genes (genic reads).
 For the non-GB samples, this measure ranges from 10.9% to 80.9%, while for
 the GB samples it ranges from 81.9% to 99.9% (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

).
 This means that for applications where it is critical that each sample
 achieve a specified minimum coverage in order to provide useful information,
 it would be necessary to budget up to 10 times the sequencing depth per
 sample without globin blocking, even though the average yield improvement
 for globin blocking is only 2-fold, because every sample has a chance of
 being 90% globin and 10% useful reads.
 Hence, the more consistent behavior of GB samples makes planning an experiment
 easier and more efficient because it eliminates the need to over-sequence
 every sample in order to guard against the worst case of a high-globin
 fraction.

Since globin blocking yields more usable sequencing depth, it should also
 allow detection of more genes at any given threshold.
 When we looked at the distribution of average normalized logCPM values
 across all libraries for genes with at least one read assigned to them,
 we observed the expected bimodal distribution, with a high-abundance "signal"
 peak representing detected genes and a low-abundance "noise" peak representing
 genes whose read count did not rise above the noise floor (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:logcpm-dists"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Consistent with the 2-fold increase in raw counts assigned to non-globin
 genes, the signal peak for GB samples is shifted to the right relative
 to the non-GB signal peak.
 When all the samples are normalized together, this difference is normalized
 out, lining up the signal peaks, and this reveals that, as expected, the
 noise floor for the GB samples is about 2-fold lower.
 This greater separation between signal and noise peaks in the GB samples
 means that low-expression genes should be more easily detected and more
 precisely quantified than in the non-GB samples.

Based on these distributions, we selected a detection threshold of -1, which
 is approximately the leftmost edge of the trough between the signal and
 noise peaks.
 This represents the most liberal possible detection threshold that doesn't
 call substantial numbers of noise genes as detected.
 Among the full dataset, 13429 genes were detected at this threshold, and
 22276 were not.
 When considering the GB libraries and non-GB libraries separately and re-comput
ing normalization factors independently within each group, 14535 genes were
 detected in the GB libraries while only 12460 were detected in the non-GB
 libraries.
 Thus, GB allowed the detection of 2000 extra genes that were buried under
 the noise floor without GB.
 This pattern of at least 2000 additional genes detected with GB was also
 consistent across a wide range of possible detection thresholds, from -2
 to 3 (see Figure

One potential worry is that the globin blocking protocol could perturb the
 levels of non-globin genes.
 There are two kinds of possible perturbations: systematic and random.
 The former is not a major concern for detection of differential expression,
 since a 2-fold change in every sample has no effect on the relative fold
 change between samples.
 In contrast, random perturbations would increase the noise and obscure
 the signal in the dataset, reducing the capacity to detect differential
 expression.

 Other than the 3 designated alpha and beta globin genes, two other genes
 stand out as having especially large negative log fold changes: HBD and
 LOC1021365.
 HBD, delta globin, is most likely targeted by the blocking oligos due to
 high sequence homology with the other globin genes.
 LOC1021365 is the aforementioned ncRNA that is reverse-complementary to
 one of the alpha-like genes and that would be expected to be removed during
 the globin blocking step.
 All other genes appear in a cluster centered vertically at 0, and the vast
 majority of genes in this cluster show an absolute log2(FC) of 0.5 or less.
 Nevertheless, many of these small perturbations are still statistically
 significant, indicating that the globin blocking oligos likely cause very
 small but non-zero systematic perturbations in measured gene expression
 levels.

To evaluate the possibility of globin blocking causing random perturbations
 and reducing sample quality, we computed the Pearson correlation between
 logCPM values for every pair of samples with and without GB and plotted
 them against each other (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:gene-abundance-correlations"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 The plot indicated that the GB libraries have higher sample-to-sample correlati
ons than the non-GB libraries.
 Parametric and nonparametric tests for differences between the correlations
 with and without GB both confirmed that this difference was highly significant
 (2-sided paired t-test: t = 37.2, df = 665, P ‚â™ 2.2e-16; 2-sided Wilcoxon
 sign-rank test: V = 2195, P ‚â™ 2.2e-16).
 Performing the same tests on the Spearman correlations gave the same conclusion
 (t-test: t = 26.8, df = 665, P ‚â™ 2.2e-16; sign-rank test: V = 8781, P ‚â™ 2.2e-16).
 The edgeR package was used to compute the overall biological coefficient
 of variation (BCV) for GB and non-GB libraries, and found that globin blocking
 resulted in a negligible increase in the BCV (0.417 with GB vs.
 0.400 without).
 The near equality of the BCVs for both sets indicates that the higher correlati
ons in the GB libraries are most likely a result of the increased yield
 of useful reads, which reduces the contribution of Poisson counting uncertainty
 to the overall variance of the logCPM values

 This improves the precision of expression measurements and more than offsets
 the negligible increase in BCV.

To compare performance on differential gene expression tests, we took subsets
 of both the GB and non-GB libraries with exactly one pre-transplant and
 one post-transplant sample for each animal that had paired samples available
 for analysis (N=7 animals, N=14 samples in each subset).
 The same test for pre- vs.
 post-transplant differential gene expression was performed on the same
 7 pairs of samples from GB libraries and non-GB libraries, in each case
 using an FDR of 10% as the threshold of significance.
 Out of 12954 genes that passed the detection threshold in both subsets,
 358 were called significantly differentially expressed in the same direction
 in both sets; 1063 were differentially expressed in the GB set only; 296
 were differentially expressed in the non-GB set only; 2 genes were called
 significantly up in the GB set but significantly down in the non-GB set;
 and the remaining 11235 were not called differentially expressed in either
 set.
 These data are summarized in Table

 The differences in BCV calculated by EdgeR for these subsets of samples

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key point is that the GB data results in substantially more differentially
 expressed calls than the non-GB data.
 Since there is no gold standard for this dataset, it is impossible to be
 certain whether this is due to under-calling of differential expression
 in the non-GB samples or over-calling in the GB samples.
 However, given that both datasets are derived from the same biological
 samples and have nearly equal BCVs, it is more likely that the larger number
 of DE calls in the GB samples are genuine detections that were enabled
 by the higher sequencing depth and measurement precision of the GB samples.
 Note that the same set of genes was considered in both subsets, so the
 larger number of differentially expressed gene calls in the GB data set
 reflects a greater sensitivity to detect significant differential gene
 expression and not simply the larger total number of detected genes in
 GB samples described earlier.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original experience with whole blood gene expression profiling on DNA
 microarrays demonstrated that the high concentration of globin transcripts
 reduced the sensitivity to detect genes with relatively low expression
 levels, in effect, significantly reducing the sensitivity.
 To address this limitation, commercial protocols for globin reduction were
 developed based on strategies to block globin transcript amplification
 during labeling or physically removing globin transcripts by affinity bead
 methods

key "Winn2010"

\end_inset

.
 More recently, using the latest generation of labeling protocols and arrays,
 it was determined that globin reduction was no longer necessary to obtain
 sufficient sensitivity to detect differential transcript expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NuGEN2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, we are not aware of any publications using these currently available
 protocols the with latest generation of microarrays that actually compare
 the detection sensitivity with and without globin reduction.
 However, in practice this has now been adopted generally primarily driven
 by concerns for cost control.
 The main objective of our work was to directly test the impact of globin
 gene transcripts and a new globin blocking protocol for application to
 the newest generation of differential gene expression profiling determined
 using next generation sequencing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The challenge of doing global gene expression profiling in cynomolgus monkeys
 is that the current available arrays were never designed to comprehensively
 cover this genome and have not been updated since the first assemblies
 of the cynomolgus genome were published.
 Therefore, we determined that the best strategy for peripheral blood profiling
 was to do deep RNA-seq and inform the workflow using the latest available
 genome assembly and annotation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Wilson2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, it was not immediately clear whether globin reduction was necessary
 for RNA-seq or how much improvement in efficiency or sensitivity to detect
 differential gene expression would be achieved for the added cost and work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We only found one report that demonstrated that globin reduction significantly
 improved the effective read yields for sequencing of human peripheral blood
 cell RNA using a DeepSAGE protocol 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mastrokolias2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The approach to DeepSAGE involves two different restriction enzymes that
 purify and then tag small fragments of transcripts at specific locations
 and thus, significantly reduces the complexity of the transcriptome.
 Therefore, we could not determine how DeepSAGE results would translate
 to the common strategy in the field for assaying the entire transcript
 population by whole-transcriptome 3‚Äô-end RNA-seq.
 Furthermore, if globin reduction is necessary, we also needed a globin
 reduction method specific to cynomolgus globin sequences that would work
 an organism for which no kit is available off the shelf.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above, the addition of globin blocking oligos has a very small
 impact on measured expression levels of gene expression.
 However, this is a non-issue for the purposes of differential expression
 testing, since a systematic change in a gene in all samples does not affect
 relative expression levels between samples.
 However, we must acknowledge that simple comparisons of gene expression
 data obtained by GB and non-GB protocols are not possible without additional
 normalization.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More importantly, globin blocking not only nearly doubles the yield of usable
 reads, it also increases inter-sample correlation and sensitivity to detect
 differential gene expression relative to the same set of samples profiled
 without blocking.
 In addition, globin blocking does not add a significant amount of random
 noise to the data.
 Globin blocking thus represents a cost-effective way to squeeze more data
 and statistical power out of the same blood samples and the same amount
 of sequencing.
 In conclusion, globin reduction greatly increases the yield of useful RNA-seq
 reads mapping to the rest of the genome, with minimal perturbations in
 the relative levels of non-globin genes.
 Based on these results, globin transcript reduction using sequence-specific,
 complementary blocking oligonucleotides is recommended for all deep RNA-seq
 of cynomolgus and other nonhuman primate blood samples.

Improving on the effective promoter radius
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq in CD4 T-cells in Chapter 2 is in many
 ways a preliminary study that suggests a multitude of new avenues of investigat
ion.
 This study introduced the concept of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

effective promoter radius
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 specific to each histone mark based on distince from the TSS within which
 an excess of peaks was called for that mark.
 This concept was then used to guide further analyses throughout the study.
 However, while the effective promoter radius was useful in those analyses,
 it is both limited in theory and shown in practice to be a possible oversimplif
ication.
 First, the effective promoter radii used in this study were chosen based
 on manual inspection of the TSS-to-peak distance distributions in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:near-promoter-peak-enrich"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, selecting round numbers of analyst convenience (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:effective-promoter-radius"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 It would be better to define an algorithm that selects a more precise radius
 based on the features of the graph.
 One possible way to do this would be to randomly rearrange the called peaks
 throughout the genome many (while preserving the distribution of peak widths)
 and re-generate the same plot as in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:near-promoter-peak-enrich"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 This would yield a better 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

background
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 distribution that demonstrates the degree of near-TSS enrichment that would
 be expected by random chance.
 The effective promoter radius could be defined as the point where the true
 distribution diverges from the randomized background distribution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, the above definition of effective promoter radius has the significa
nt limitation of being based on the peak calling method.
 It is thus very sensitive to the choice of peak caller and significance
 threshold for calling peaks, as well as the degree of saturation in the
 sequencing.
 Calling peaks from ChIP-seq samples with insufficient coverage depth, with
 the wrong peak caller, or with a different significance threshold could
 give a drastically different number of called peaks, and hence a drastically
 different distribution of peak-to-TSS distances.
 To address this, it is desirable to develop a better method of determining
 the effective promoter radius that relies only on the distribution of read
 coverage around the TSS, independent of the peak calling.
 Furthermore, as demonstrated by the upstream-downstream asymmetries observed
 in Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:H3K4me2-neighborhood"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:H3K4me3-neighborhood"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:H3K27me3-neighborhood"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, this definition should determine a different radius for the upstream and
 downstream directions.
 At this point, it may be better to call these values 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

effective promoter extents
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rather than radii, since a radius implies a symmetry about the TSS that
 is not supported by the data.

 Investigate causes: do the same histones have one of each, or do different

 to do something like allele-specific single-cell ChIP-seq.
