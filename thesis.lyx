\begin_layout Standard
Microarrays, bead ararys, and similar assays produce raw data in the form
 of fluorescence intensity measurements, with the each intensity measurement
 proportional to the abundance of some fluorescently-labelled target DNA
 or RNA sequence that base pairs to a specific probe sequence.
 However, these measurements for each probe are also affected my many technical
 confounding factors, such as the concentration of target material, strength
 of off-target binding, and the sensitivity of the imaging sensor.
 Some array designs also use multiple probe sequences for each target.
 Hence, extensive pre-processing of array data is necessary to normalize
 out the effects of these technical factors and summarize the information
 from multiple probes to arrive at a single usable estimate of abundance
 or other relevant quantity, such as a ratio of two abundances, for each
 target.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The choice of pre-processing algorithms used in the analysis of an array
 data set can have a large effect on the results of that analysis.
 However, despite their importance, these steps are often neglected or rushed
 in order to get to the more scientifically interesting analysis steps involving
 the actual biology of the system under study.
 Hence, it is often possible to achieve substantial gains in statistical
 power, model goodness-of-fit, or other relevant performance measures, by
 checking the assumptions made by each preprocessing step and choosing specific
 normalization methods tailored to the specific goals of the current analysis.

\begin_layout Subsection
Frozen RMA for clinical microarray classifiers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Standard normalization methods are unsuitable for clinical application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the cost of performing microarray assays falls, there is increasing interest
 in using genomic assays for diagnostic purposes, such as distinguishing
 healthy transplants (TX) from transplants undergoing acute rejection (AR)
 or acute dysfunction with no rejection (ADNR).
 However, the the standard normalization algorithm used for microarray data,
 Robust Multi-chip Average (RMA) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Irizarry2003a"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, is not applicable in a clinical setting.
 Two of the steps in RMA, quantile normalization and probe summarization
 by median polish, depend on every array in the data set being normalized.
 This means that adding or removing any arrays from a data set changes the
 normalized values for all arrays, and data sets that have been normalized
 separately cannot be compared to each other.
 Hence, when using RMA, any arrays to be analyzed together must also be
 normalized together, and the set of arrays included in the data set must
 be held constant throughout an analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These limitations present serious impediments to the use of arrays as a
 diagnostic tool.
 When training a classifier, the samples to be classified must not be involved
 in any step of the training process, lest their inclusion bias the training
 process.
 Once a classifier is deployed in a clinical setting, the samples to be
 classified will not even 
\emph on
exist
\emph default
 at the time of training, so including them would be impossible even if
 it were statistically justifiable.
 Therefore, any machine learning application for microarrays demands that
 the normalized expression values computed for an array must depend only
 on information contained within that array.
 This would ensure that each array's normalization is independent of every
 other array, and that arrays normalized separately can still be compared
 to each other without bias.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Frozen RMA satisfies clinical normalization requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frozen RMA (fRMA) addresses these concerns by replacing the quantile normalizati
on and median polish with alternatives that do not introduce inter-array
 dependence, allowing each array to be normalized independently of all others
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McCall2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Quantile normalization is performed against a pre-generated set of quantiles
 learned from a collection of 850 publically available arrays sampled from
 a wide variety of tissues in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
 Each array's probe intensity distribution is normalized against these pre-gener
ated quantiles.
 The median polish step is replaced with a robust weighted average of probe
 intensities, using inverse variance weights learned from the same public
 GEO data.
 The result is a normalization that satisfies the requirements mentioned
 above: each array is normalized independently of all others, and any two
 normalized arrays can be compared directly to each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One important limitation of fRMA is that it requires a separate reference
 data set from which to learn the parameters (reference quantiles and probe
 weights) that will be used to normalize each array.
 These parameters are specific to a given array platform, and pre-generated
 parameters are only provided for the most common platforms, such as Affymetrix
 hgu133plus2.
 For a less common platform, such as hthgu133pluspm, is is necessary to
 learn custom parameters from in-house data before fRMA can be used to normalize
 samples on that platform

Adapting voom to model heteroskedasticity in methylation array data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Methylation array preprocessing induces heteroskedasticity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DNA methylation arrays are a relatively new kind of assay that uses microarrays
 to measure the degree of methylation on cytosines in specific regions arrayed
 across the genome.
 First, bisulfite treatment converts all unmethylated cytosines to uracil
 (which then become thymine after amplication) while leaving methylated
 cytosines unaffected.
 Then, each target region is interrogated with two probes: one binds to
 the original genomic sequence and interrogates the level of methylated
 DNA, and the other binds to the sequence with all Cs replaced by Ts and
 interrogates the level of unmethylated DNA.

 β
\series bold
 
\series default
values are conceptually easy to interpret, but the constrained range makes
 them unsuitable for linear modeling, and their error distributions are
 highly non-normal, which also frustrates linear modeling.
 M-values, interpreted as the log ratio of methylated to unmethylated copies,
 are computed by mapping the beta values from 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

 onto 
\begin_inset Formula $(-\infty,+\infty)$
\end_inset

 using a sigmoid curve (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Sigmoid-beta-m-mapping"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 This transformation results in values with better statistical perperties:
 the unconstrained range is suitable for linear modeling, and the error
 distributions are more normal.
 Hence, most linear modeling and other statistical testing on methylation
 arrays is performed using M-values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the steep slope of the sigmoid transformation near 0 and 1 tends
 to over-exaggerate small differences in β values near those extremes, which
 in turn amplifies the error in those values, leading to a U-shaped trend
 in the mean-variance curve.
 This mean-variance dependency must be accounted for when fitting the linear
 model for differential methylation, or else the variance will be systematically
 overestimated for probes with moderate M-values and underestimated for
 probes with extreme M-values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The voom method for RNA-seq data can model this heteroskedasticity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
RNA-seq read count data are also known to show heteroskedasticity, and the
 voom method was developed for modeling this heteroskedasticity by estimating
 the mean-variance trend in the data and using this trend to assign precision
 weights to each observation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Law2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 While methylation array data are not derived from counts and have a very
 different mean-variance relationship from that of typical RNA-seq data,
 the voom method makes no specific assumptions on the shape of the mean-variance
 relationship - it only assumes that the relationship is smooth enough to
 model using a lowess curve.
 Hence, the method is sufficiently general to model the mean-variance relationsh
ip in methylation array data.
 However, the standard implementation of voom assumes that the input is
 given in raw read counts, and minor adjustments are required to run it
 on methylation M-values.

 To demonstrate the problem, we considered the problem of training a classifier
 to distinguish TX from AR using the TX and AR samples from the training
 set and validation set as training data, evaluating performance on the
 external validation set.
 First, training and evaluation were performed after normalizing all array
 samples together as a single set using RMA, and second, the internal samples
 were normalized separately from the external samples and the training and
 evaluation were repeated.
 For each sample in the validation set, the classifier probabilities from
 both classifiers were plotted against each other (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 As expected, separate normalization biases the classifier probabilities,
 resulting in several misclassifications.
 In this case, the bias from separate normalization causes the classifier
 to assign a lower probability of AR to every sample.
 Because it is not feasible to normalize all samples together in a clinical
 context, this shows that an alternative to RMA is required.

Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Primate blood contains high concentrations of globin messenger RNA.
 Globin reduction is a standard technique used to improve the expression
 results obtained by DNA microarrays on RNA from blood samples.
 However, with whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) quickly replacing
 microarrays for many applications, the impact of globin reduction for RNA-seq
 has not been previously studied.
 Moreover, no off-the-shelf kits are available for globin reduction in nonhuman
 primates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we report a protocol for RNA-seq in primate blood samples that uses
 complimentary oligonucleotides to block reverse transcription of the alpha
 and beta globin genes.
 In test samples from cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), this globin
 blocking protocol approximately doubles the yield of informative (non-globin)
 reads by greatly reducing the fraction of globin reads, while also improving
 the consistency in sequencing depth between samples.
 The increased yield enables detection of about 2000 more genes, significantly
 increases the correlation in measured gene expression levels between samples,
 and increases the sensitivity of differential gene expression tests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These results show that globin blocking significantly improves the cost-effectiv
eness of mRNA sequencing in primate blood samples by doubling the yield
 of useful reads, allowing detection of more genes, and improving the precision
 of gene expression measurements.
 Based on these results, a globin reducing or blocking protocol is recommended
 for all RNA-seq studies of primate blood samples.

 In the present report, we evaluated globin reduction using custom blocking
 oligonucleotides for deep RNA-seq of peripheral blood samples from a nonhuman
 primate, cynomolgus monkey, using the Illumina technology platform.
 We demonstrate that globin reduction significantly improves the cost-effectiven
ess of RNA-seq in blood samples.
 Thus, our protocol offers a significant advantage to any investigator planning
 to use RNA-seq for gene expression profiling of nonhuman primate blood
 samples.
 Our method can be generally applied to any species by designing complementary
 oligonucleotide blocking probes to the globin gene sequences of that species.
 Indeed, any highly expressed but biologically uninformative transcripts
 can also be blocked to further increase sequencing efficiency and value

RNA-seq Library Preparation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sequencing libraries were prepared with 200ng total RNA from each sample.
 Polyadenylated mRNA was selected from 200 ng aliquots of cynomologus blood-deri
ved total RNA using Ambion Dynabeads Oligo(dT)25 beads (Invitrogen) following
 manufacturer’s recommended protocol.
 PolyA selected RNA was then combined with 8 pmol of HBA1/2 (site 1), 8
 pmol of HBA1/2 (site 2), 12 pmol of HBB (site 1) and 12 pmol of HBB (site
 2) oligonucleotides.
 In addition, 20 pmol of RT primer containing a portion of the Illumina
 adapter sequence (B-oligo-dTV: GAGTTCCTTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTV)
 and 4 µL of 5X First Strand buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl,
 15mM MgCl2) were added in a total volume of 15 µL.
 The RNA was fragmented by heating this cocktail for 3 minutes at 95°C and
 then placed on ice.
 This was followed by the addition of 2 µL 0.1 M DTT, 1 µL RNaseOUT, 1 µL
 10mM dNTPs 10% biotin-16 aminoallyl-2’- dUTP and 10% biotin-16 aminoallyl-2’-
 dCTP (TriLink Biotech, San Diego, CA), 1 µL Superscript II (200U/ µL, Thermo-Fi
sher).
 A second “unblocked” library was prepared in the same way for each sample
 but replacing the blocking oligos with an equivalent volume of water.
 The reaction was carried out at 25°C for 15 minutes and 42°C for 40 minutes,
 followed by incubation at 75°C for 10 minutes to inactivate the reverse
 transcriptase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cDNA/RNA hybrid molecules were purified using 1.8X Ampure XP beads (Agencourt
) following supplier’s recommended protocol.
 The cDNA/RNA hybrid was eluted in 25 µL of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and then
 bound to 25 µL of M280 Magnetic Streptavidin beads washed per recommended
 protocol (Thermo-Fisher).
 After 30 minutes of binding, beads were washed one time in 100 µL 0.1N NaOH
 to denature and remove the bound RNA, followed by two 100 µL washes with
 1X TE buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subsequent attachment of the 5-prime Illumina A adapter was performed by
 on-bead random primer extension of the following sequence (A-N8 primer:
 TTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGACGATCNNNNNNNN).
 Briefly, beads were resuspended in a 20 µL reaction containing 5 µM A-N8
 primer, 40mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 20mM MgCl2, 50mM NaCl, 0.325U/µL Sequenase
 2.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), 0.0025U/µL inorganic pyrophosphatase (Affymetr
ix) and 300 µM each dNTP.
 Reaction was incubated at 22°C for 30 minutes, then beads were washed 2
 times with 1X TE buffer (200µL).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The magnetic streptavidin beads were resuspended in 34 µL nuclease-free
 water and added directly to a PCR tube.
 The two Illumina protocol-specified PCR primers were added at 0.53 µM (Illumina

PCR products were purified with 1X Ampure Beads following manufacturer’s

 Libraries were then analyzed using the Agilent TapeStation and quantitation

 Samples were pooled in equimolar batches of 16 samples.
 Pooled libraries were size selected on 2% agarose gels (E-Gel EX Agarose
 Gels; Thermo-Fisher).
 Products were cut between 250 and 350 bp (corresponding to insert sizes
 of 130 to 230 bps).

 A few artifacts in the cynomolgus genome annotation complicated read counting.
 First, no ortholog is annotated for alpha globin in the cynomolgus genome,
 presumably because the human genome has two alpha globin genes with nearly
 identical sequences, making the orthology relationship ambiguous.
 However, two loci in the cynomolgus genome are as “hemoglobin subunit alpha-lik
e” (LOC102136192 and LOC102136846).
 LOC102136192 is annotated as a pseudogene while LOC102136846 is annotated
 as protein-coding.
 Our globin reduction protocol was designed to include blocking of these
 two genes.
 Indeed, these two genes have almost the same read counts in each library
 as the properly-annotated HBB gene and much larger counts than any other
 gene in the unblocked libraries, giving confidence that reads derived from
 the real alpha globin are mapping to both genes.
 Thus, reads from both of these loci were counted as alpha globin reads
 in all further analyses.
 The second artifact is a small, uncharacterized non-coding RNA gene (LOC1021365
91), which overlaps the HBA-like gene (LOC102136192) on the opposite strand.
 If counting is not performed in stranded mode (or if a non-strand-specific
 sequencing protocol is used), many reads mapping to the globin gene will
 be discarded as ambiguous due to their overlap with this ncRNA gene, resulting
 in significant undercounting of globin reads.
 Therefore, stranded sense counts were used for all further analysis in
 the present study to insure that we accurately accounted for globin transcript
 reduction.
 However, we note that stranded reads are not necessary for RNA-seq using
 our protocol in standard practice.

.
 Log2 counts per million values (logCPM) were calculated using the cpm function
 in edgeR for individual samples and aveLogCPM function for averages across
 groups of samples, using those functions’ default prior count values to
 avoid taking the logarithm of 0.
 Genes were considered “present” if their average normalized logCPM values
 across all libraries were at least -1.
 Normalizing for gene length was unnecessary because the sequencing protocol
 is 3’-biased and hence the expected read count for each gene is related
 to the transcript’s copy number but not its length.

\begin_layout Standard
In order to assess the effect of blocking on reproducibility, Pearson and
 Spearman correlation coefficients were computed between the logCPM values

 To investigate the effects of globin blocking on each gene, an additive
 model was fit to the full data with coefficients for globin blocking and
 SampleID.
 To test the effect of globin blocking on detection of differentially expressed
 genes, the GB samples and non-GB samples were each analyzed independently
 as follows: for each animal with both a pre-transplant and a post-transplant
 time point in the data set, the pre-transplant sample and the earliest
 post-transplant sample were selected, and all others were excluded, yielding
 a pre-/post-transplant pair of samples for each animal (N=7 animals with
 paired samples).
 These samples were analyzed for pre-transplant vs.
 post-transplant differential gene expression while controlling for inter-animal
 variation using an additive model with coefficients for transplant and
 animal ID.
 In all analyses, p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure
 for FDR correction

Globin blocking yields a larger and more consistent fraction of useful reads
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of the present study was to validate a new protocol for deep
 RNA-seq of whole blood drawn into PaxGene tubes from cynomolgus monkeys
 undergoing islet transplantation, with particular focus on minimizing the
 loss of useful sequencing space to uninformative globin reads.
 The details of the analysis with respect to transplant outcomes and the
 impact of mesenchymal stem cell treatment will be reported in a separate
 manuscript (in preparation).
 To focus on the efficacy of our globin blocking protocol, 37 blood samples,
 16 from pre-transplant and 21 from post-transplant time points, were each
 prepped once with and once without globin blocking oligos, and were then
 sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 instrument.
 The number of reads aligning to each gene in the cynomolgus genome was
 counted.
 Table 1 summarizes the distribution of read fractions among the GB and
 non-GB libraries.
 In the libraries with no globin blocking, globin reads made up an average
 of 44.6% of total input reads, while reads assigned to all other genes made
 up an average of 26.3%.
 The remaining reads either aligned to intergenic regions (that include
 long non-coding RNAs) or did not align with any annotated transcripts in
 the current build of the cynomolgus genome.
 In the GB libraries, globin reads made up only 3.48% and reads assigned
 to all other genes increased to 50.4%.
 Thus, globin blocking resulted in a 92.2% reduction in globin reads and
 a 91.6% increase in yield of useful non-globin reads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This reduction is not quite as efficient as the previous analysis showed
 for human samples by DeepSAGE (<0.4% globin reads after globin reduction)
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mastrokolias2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Nonetheless, this degree of globin reduction is sufficient to nearly double
 the yield of useful reads.
 Thus, globin blocking cuts the required sequencing effort (and costs) to
 achieve a target coverage depth by almost 50%.
 Consistent with this near doubling of yield, the average difference in
 un-normalized logCPM across all genes between the GB libraries and non-GB
 libraries is approximately 1 (mean = 1.01, median = 1.08), an overall 2-fold
 increase.
 Un-normalized values are used here because the TMM normalization correctly
 identifies this 2-fold difference as biologically irrelevant and removes
 it.

Fraction of genic reads in each sample aligned to non-globin genes, with

\series default
 All reads in each sequencing library were aligned to the cyno genome, and
 the number of reads uniquely aligning to each gene was counted.
 For each sample, counts were summed separately for all globin genes and
 for the remainder of the genes (non-globin genes), and the fraction of
 genic reads aligned to non-globin genes was computed.
 Each point represents an individual sample.
 Gray + signs indicate the means for globin-blocked libraries and unblocked
 libraries.
 The overall distribution for each group is represented as a notched box

 are uniformly smaller in the GB samples than the non-GB ones, indicating
 much greater consistency of yield.
 This is best seen in the percentage of non-globin reads as a fraction of
 total reads aligned to annotated genes (genic reads).
 For the non-GB samples, this measure ranges from 10.9% to 80.9%, while for
 the GB samples it ranges from 81.9% to 99.9% (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 This means that for applications where it is critical that each sample
 achieve a specified minimum coverage in order to provide useful information,
 it would be necessary to budget up to 10 times the sequencing depth per
 sample without globin blocking, even though the average yield improvement
 for globin blocking is only 2-fold, because every sample has a chance of
 being 90% globin and 10% useful reads.
 Hence, the more consistent behavior of GB samples makes planning an experiment
 easier and more efficient because it eliminates the need to over-sequence
 every sample in order to guard against the worst case of a high-globin
 fraction.

Since globin blocking yields more usable sequencing depth, it should also
 allow detection of more genes at any given threshold.
 When we looked at the distribution of average normalized logCPM values
 across all libraries for genes with at least one read assigned to them,
 we observed the expected bimodal distribution, with a high-abundance "signal"
 peak representing detected genes and a low-abundance "noise" peak representing
 genes whose read count did not rise above the noise floor (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:logcpm-dists"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Consistent with the 2-fold increase in raw counts assigned to non-globin
 genes, the signal peak for GB samples is shifted to the right relative
 to the non-GB signal peak.
 When all the samples are normalized together, this difference is normalized
 out, lining up the signal peaks, and this reveals that, as expected, the
 noise floor for the GB samples is about 2-fold lower.
 This greater separation between signal and noise peaks in the GB samples
 means that low-expression genes should be more easily detected and more
 precisely quantified than in the non-GB samples.

Based on these distributions, we selected a detection threshold of -1, which
 is approximately the leftmost edge of the trough between the signal and
 noise peaks.
 This represents the most liberal possible detection threshold that doesn't
 call substantial numbers of noise genes as detected.
 Among the full dataset, 13429 genes were detected at this threshold, and
 22276 were not.
 When considering the GB libraries and non-GB libraries separately and re-comput
ing normalization factors independently within each group, 14535 genes were
 detected in the GB libraries while only 12460 were detected in the non-GB
 libraries.
 Thus, GB allowed the detection of 2000 extra genes that were buried under
 the noise floor without GB.
 This pattern of at least 2000 additional genes detected with GB was also
 consistent across a wide range of possible detection thresholds, from -2
 to 3 (see Figure

One potential worry is that the globin blocking protocol could perturb the
 levels of non-globin genes.
 There are two kinds of possible perturbations: systematic and random.
 The former is not a major concern for detection of differential expression,
 since a 2-fold change in every sample has no effect on the relative fold
 change between samples.
 In contrast, random perturbations would increase the noise and obscure
 the signal in the dataset, reducing the capacity to detect differential
 expression.

\end_inset

).
 Other than the 3 designated alpha and beta globin genes, two other genes
 stand out as having especially large negative log fold changes: HBD and
 LOC1021365.
 HBD, delta globin, is most likely targeted by the blocking oligos due to
 high sequence homology with the other globin genes.
 LOC1021365 is the aforementioned ncRNA that is reverse-complementary to
 one of the alpha-like genes and that would be expected to be removed during
 the globin blocking step.
 All other genes appear in a cluster centered vertically at 0, and the vast
 majority of genes in this cluster show an absolute log2(FC) of 0.5 or less.
 Nevertheless, many of these small perturbations are still statistically
 significant, indicating that the globin blocking oligos likely cause very
 small but non-zero systematic perturbations in measured gene expression
 levels.

To evaluate the possibility of globin blocking causing random perturbations

 logCPM values for every pair of samples with and without GB and plotted
 them against each other (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 The plot indicated that the GB libraries have higher sample-to-sample correlati
ons than the non-GB libraries.
 Parametric and nonparametric tests for differences between the correlations
 with and without GB both confirmed that this difference was highly significant
 (2-sided paired t-test: t = 37.2, df = 665, P ≪ 2.2e-16; 2-sided Wilcoxon
 sign-rank test: V = 2195, P ≪ 2.2e-16).
 Performing the same tests on the Spearman correlations gave the same conclusion
 (t-test: t = 26.8, df = 665, P ≪ 2.2e-16; sign-rank test: V = 8781, P ≪ 2.2e-16).
 The edgeR package was used to compute the overall biological coefficient
 of variation (BCV) for GB and non-GB libraries, and found that globin blocking
 resulted in a negligible increase in the BCV (0.417 with GB vs.
 0.400 without).
 The near equality of the BCVs for both sets indicates that the higher correlati
ons in the GB libraries are most likely a result of the increased yield
 of useful reads, which reduces the contribution of Poisson counting uncertainty
 to the overall variance of the logCPM values

.
 This improves the precision of expression measurements and more than offsets
 the negligible increase in BCV.

\begin_layout Standard
To compare performance on differential gene expression tests, we took subsets
 of both the GB and non-GB libraries with exactly one pre-transplant and
 one post-transplant sample for each animal that had paired samples available
 for analysis (N=7 animals, N=14 samples in each subset).
 The same test for pre- vs.
 post-transplant differential gene expression was performed on the same
 7 pairs of samples from GB libraries and non-GB libraries, in each case
 using an FDR of 10% as the threshold of significance.
 Out of 12954 genes that passed the detection threshold in both subsets,
 358 were called significantly differentially expressed in the same direction
 in both sets; 1063 were differentially expressed in the GB set only; 296
 were differentially expressed in the non-GB set only; 2 genes were called
 significantly up in the GB set but significantly down in the non-GB set;
 and the remaining 11235 were not called differentially expressed in either
 set.
 These data are summarized in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:Comparison-of-significant"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

.
 The differences in BCV calculated by EdgeR for these subsets of samples
 were negligible (BCV = 0.302 for GB and 0.297 for non-GB).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key point is that the GB data results in substantially more differentially
 expressed calls than the non-GB data.
 Since there is no gold standard for this dataset, it is impossible to be
 certain whether this is due to under-calling of differential expression
 in the non-GB samples or over-calling in the GB samples.
 However, given that both datasets are derived from the same biological
 samples and have nearly equal BCVs, it is more likely that the larger number
 of DE calls in the GB samples are genuine detections that were enabled
 by the higher sequencing depth and measurement precision of the GB samples.
 Note that the same set of genes was considered in both subsets, so the
 larger number of differentially expressed gene calls in the GB data set
 reflects a greater sensitivity to detect significant differential gene
 expression and not simply the larger total number of detected genes in
 GB samples described earlier.

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original experience with whole blood gene expression profiling on DNA
 microarrays demonstrated that the high concentration of globin transcripts
 reduced the sensitivity to detect genes with relatively low expression
 levels, in effect, significantly reducing the sensitivity.
 To address this limitation, commercial protocols for globin reduction were
 developed based on strategies to block globin transcript amplification
 during labeling or physically removing globin transcripts by affinity bead
 methods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Winn2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 More recently, using the latest generation of labeling protocols and arrays,
 it was determined that globin reduction was no longer necessary to obtain
 sufficient sensitivity to detect differential transcript expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NuGEN2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, we are not aware of any publications using these currently available
 protocols the with latest generation of microarrays that actually compare
 the detection sensitivity with and without globin reduction.
 However, in practice this has now been adopted generally primarily driven
 by concerns for cost control.
 The main objective of our work was to directly test the impact of globin
 gene transcripts and a new globin blocking protocol for application to
 the newest generation of differential gene expression profiling determined
 using next generation sequencing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The challenge of doing global gene expression profiling in cynomolgus monkeys
 is that the current available arrays were never designed to comprehensively
 cover this genome and have not been updated since the first assemblies
 of the cynomolgus genome were published.
 Therefore, we determined that the best strategy for peripheral blood profiling
 was to do deep RNA-seq and inform the workflow using the latest available
 genome assembly and annotation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Wilson2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, it was not immediately clear whether globin reduction was necessary
 for RNA-seq or how much improvement in efficiency or sensitivity to detect
 differential gene expression would be achieved for the added cost and work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We only found one report that demonstrated that globin reduction significantly
 improved the effective read yields for sequencing of human peripheral blood
 cell RNA using a DeepSAGE protocol 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mastrokolias2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The approach to DeepSAGE involves two different restriction enzymes that
 purify and then tag small fragments of transcripts at specific locations
 and thus, significantly reduces the complexity of the transcriptome.
 Therefore, we could not determine how DeepSAGE results would translate
 to the common strategy in the field for assaying the entire transcript
 population by whole-transcriptome 3’-end RNA-seq.
 Furthermore, if globin reduction is necessary, we also needed a globin
 reduction method specific to cynomolgus globin sequences that would work
 an organism for which no kit is available off the shelf.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above, the addition of globin blocking oligos has a very small
 impact on measured expression levels of gene expression.
 However, this is a non-issue for the purposes of differential expression
 testing, since a systematic change in a gene in all samples does not affect
 relative expression levels between samples.
 However, we must acknowledge that simple comparisons of gene expression
 data obtained by GB and non-GB protocols are not possible without additional
 normalization.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More importantly, globin blocking not only nearly doubles the yield of usable
 reads, it also increases inter-sample correlation and sensitivity to detect
 differential gene expression relative to the same set of samples profiled
 without blocking.
 In addition, globin blocking does not add a significant amount of random
 noise to the data.
 Globin blocking thus represents a cost-effective way to squeeze more data
 and statistical power out of the same blood samples and the same amount
 of sequencing.
 In conclusion, globin reduction greatly increases the yield of useful RNA-seq
 reads mapping to the rest of the genome, with minimal perturbations in
 the relative levels of non-globin genes.
 Based on these results, globin transcript reduction using sequence-specific,
 complementary blocking oligonucleotides is recommended for all deep RNA-seq
 of cynomolgus and other nonhuman primate blood samples.
