\begin_layout Standard
Transplant rejection mediated by adaptive immune response is the major challenge
 to long-term graft survival.
 Rejection is treated with immune suppressive drugs, but early diagnosis
 is essential for effective treatment.
 Memory lymphocytes are known to resist immune suppression, but the precise
 regulatory mechanisms underlying immune memory are still poorly understood.
 High-throughput genomic assays like microarrays, RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq
 are heavily used in the study of immunology and transplant rejection.
 Here we present 3 analyses of such assays in this context.
 First, we re-analyze a large data set consisting of H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and
 H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data and RNA-seq data in naïve and memory CD4
\begin_inset Formula $^{+}$
\end_inset

 T-cells using modern bioinformatics methods designed to address deficiencies
 in the data and extend the analysis in several new directions.
 All 3 histone marks are found to occur in broad regions and are enriched
 near promoters, but the radius of promoter enrichment is found to be larger
 for H3K27me3.
 We observe that both gene expression and promoter histone methylation in
 naïve and memory cells converges on a common signature 14 days after activation
, consistent with differentiation of naïve cells into memory cells.
 The location of histone modifications within the promoter is also found
 to be important, with asymmetric associations with gene expression for
 peaks located the same distance up- or downstream of the TSS.
 Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of fRMA as a single-channel normalizat
ion for using expression arrays to diagnose transplant rejection in a clinical
 diagnostic setting, and we develop a custom fRMA normalization for a previously
 unsupported array platform.
 For methylation arrays, we adapt methods designed for RNA-seq to improve
 the sensitivity of differential methylation analysis by modeling the heterosked
asticity inherent in the data.
 Finally, we present and validate a novel method for RNA-seq of cynomolgus
 monkey blood samples using complementary oligonucleotides to prevent wasteful
 over-sequencing of globin genes.
 These results all demonstrate the usefulness of a toolbox full of flexible
 and modular analysis methods in analyzing complex high-throughput assays
 in contexts ranging from basic science to translational medicine.

Notes to draft readers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Thank you so much for agreeing to read my thesis and give me feedback on
 it.
 What you are currently reading is a rough draft, in need of many revisions.
 You can always find the latest version at 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "https://mneme.dedyn.io/~ryan/Thesis/thesis.pdf"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 the PDF at this link is updated periodically with my latest revisions,
 but you can just download the current version and give me feedback on that.
 Don't worry about keeping up with the updates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As for what feedback I'm looking for, first of all, don't waste your time
 marking spelling mistakes and such.
 I haven't run a spell checker on it yet, so let me worry about that.
 Also, I'm aware that many abbreviations are not properly introduced the
 first time they are used, so don't worry about that either.
 However, if you see any glaring formatting issues, such as a figure being
 too large and getting cut off at the edge of the page, please note them.
 In addition, if any of the text in the figures is too small, please note
 that as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Beyond that, what I'm mainly interested in is feedback on the content.
 For example: does the introduction flow logically, and does it provide
 enough background to understand the other chapters? Does each chapter make
 it clear what work and analyses I have done? Do the figures clearly communicate
 the results I'm trying to show? Do you feel that the claims in the results
 and discussion sections are well-supported? There's no need to suggest
 improvements; just note areas that you feel need improvement.
 Additionally, if you notice any un-cited claims in any chapter, please
 flag them for my attention.
 Similarly, if you discover any factual errors, please note them as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
You can provide your feedback in whatever way is most convenient to you.
 You could mark up this PDF with highlights and notes, then send it back
 to me.
 Or you could collect your comments in a separate text file and send that
 to me, or whatever else you like.
 However, if you send me your feedback in a separate document, please note
 a section/figure/table number for each comment, and 
\emph on
also
\emph default
 send me the exact PDF that you read so I can reference it while reading
 your comments, since as mentioned above, the current version I'm working
 on will have changed by that point (which might include shuffling sections
 and figures around, changing their numbers).
 One last thing: you'll see a bunch of text in orange boxes throughout the
 PDF.
 These are notes to myself about things that need to be fixed later, so
 if you see a problem noted in an orange box, that means I'm already aware
 of it, and there's no need to comment on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
My thesis is due Thursday, October 10th, so in order to be useful to me,
 I'll need your feedback at least several days before that, ideally by Monday,
 October 7th.
 If you have limited time and are unable to get through the whole thesis,
 please focus your efforts on Chapters 1 and 2, since those are the roughest
 and most in need of revision.
 Chapter 3 is fairly short and straightforward, and Chapter 4 is an adaptation
 of a paper that's already been through a few rounds of revision, so they
 should be a lot tighter.
 If you can't spare any time between now and then, or if something unexpected
 comes up, I understand.
 Just let me know.

Rejection is the major long-term threat to organ and tissue allografts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Organ and tissue transplants are a life-saving treatment for people who
 have lost the function of an important organ.
 In some cases, it is possible to transplant a patient's own tissue from
 one area of their body to another, referred to as an autograft.
 This is common for tissues that are distributed throughout many areas of
 the body, such as skin and bone.
 However, in cases of organ failure, there is no functional self tissue
 remaining, and a transplant from another person – a donor – is required.
 This is referred to as an allograft 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Valenzuela2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because an allograft comes from a donor of the same species who is genetically
 distinct from the recipient (with rare exceptions), genetic variants in
 protein-coding regions affect the polypeptide sequences encoded by the
 affected genes, resulting in protein products in the allograft that differ
 from the equivalent proteins produced by the graft recipient's own tissue.
 As a result, without intervention, the recipient's immune system will eventuall
y identify the graft as foreign tissue and begin attacking it.
 This is called an alloimmune response, and if left unchecked, it eventually
 results in failure and death of the graft, a process referred to as transplant
 rejection 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Murphy2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Rejection is the primary obstacle to long-term health and survival of an
 allograft 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Valenzuela2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Like any adaptive immune response, an alloimmune response generally occurs
 via two broad mechanisms: cellular immunity, in which CD8
\begin_inset Formula $^{+}$
\end_inset

  T-cells recognizing graft-specific antigens induce apoptosis in the graft
 cells; and humoral immunity, in which B-cells produce antibodies that bind
 to graft proteins and direct an immune response against the graft 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Murphy2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In either case, alloimmunity and rejection show most of the typical hallmarks
 of an adaptive immune response, in particular mediation by CD4

 T-cells and formation of immune memory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Diagnosis and treatment of allograft rejection is a major challenge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To prevent rejection, allograft recipients are treated with immune suppressive
 drugs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kowalski2003,Murphy2012"

\end_inset

.
 The goal is to achieve sufficient suppression of the immune system to prevent
 rejection of the graft without compromising the ability of the immune system
 to raise a normal response against infection.
 As such, a delicate balance must be struck: insufficient immune suppression
 may lead to rejection and ultimately loss of the graft; excessive suppression
 leaves the patient vulnerable to life-threatening opportunistic infections
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Because every patient's matabolism is different, achieving this delicate
 balance requires drug dosage to be tailored for each patient.
 Furthermore, dosage must be tuned over time, as the immune system's activity
 varies over time and in response to external stimuli with no fixed pattern.
 In order to properly adjust the dosage of immune suppression drugs, it
 is necessary to monitor the health of the transplant and increase the dosage
 if evidence of rejection or alloimmune activity is observed.

However, diagnosis of rejection is a significant challenge.
 Early diagnosis is essential in order to step up immune suppression before
 the immune system damages the graft beyond recovery

 When a patient shows symptoms of possible rejection, a

However, biopsies have a number of downsides that limit their effectiveness
 as a diagnostic tool.
 First, the need for manual inspection by a histologist means that diagnosis
 is subject to the biases of the particular histologist examining the biopsy
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kurian2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In marginal cases, two different histologists may give two different diagnoses
 to the same biopsy.
 Second, a biopsy can only evaluate if rejection is occurring in the section
 of the graft from which the tissue was extracted.
 If rejection is localized to one section of the graft and the tissue is
 extracted from a different section, a false negative diagnosis may result.
 Most importantly, extraction of tissue from a graft is invasive and is
 treated as an injury by the body, which results in inflammation that in
 turn promotes increased immune system activity.
 Hence, the invasiveness of biopsies severely limits the frequency with
 which they can safely be performed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Typically, protocol biopsies are not scheduled more than about once per
 month 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 A less invasive diagnostic test for rejection would bring manifold benefits.
 Such a test would enable more frequent testing and therefore earlier detection
 of rejection events.
 In addition, having a larger pool of historical data for a given patient
 would make it easier to evaluate when a given test is outside the normal
 parameters for that specific patient, rather than relying on normal ranges
 for the population as a whole.
 Lastly, the accumulated data from more frequent tests would be a boon to
 the transplant research community.
 Beyond simply providing more data overall, the better time granularity
 of the tests will enable studying the progression of a rejection event
 on the scale of days to weeks, rather than months.

Memory cells are resistant to immune suppression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the defining features of the adaptive immune system is immune memory:
 the ability of the immune system to recognize a previously encountered
 foreign antigen and respond more quickly and more strongly to that antigen
 in subsequent encounters 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Murphy2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 When the immune system first encounters a new antigen, the T-cells that
 respond are known as naïve cells – T-cells that have never detected their
 target antigens before.
 Once activated by their specific antigen presented by an antigen-presenting
 cell in the proper co-stimulatory context, naïve cells differentiate into
 effector cells that carry out their respective functions in targeting and
 destroying the source of the foreign antigen.
 The 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 is cell-surface protein complex produced by T-cells that is responsible
 for recognizing the T-cell's specific antigen, presented on a 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\begin_layout Plain Layout
MHC
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the cell-surface protein complex used by an 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 to present antigens to the T-cell.
 However, a naïve T-cell that recognizes its antigen also requires a co-stimulat
ory signal, delivered through other interactions between 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
APC
\end_layout

\end_inset

 surface proteins and T-cell surface proteins such as CD28.
 Without proper co-stimulation, a T-cell that recognizes its antigen either
 dies or enters an unresponsive state known as anergy, in which the T-cell
 becomes much more resistant to subsequent activation even with proper co-stimul
ation.
 The dependency of activation on co-stimulation is an important feature
 of naïve lymphocytes that limits 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

false positive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 immune responses against self antigens, because 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term (pl)
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
APC
\end_layout

\end_inset

 usually only express the proper co-stimulation after the innate immune
 system detects signs of an active infection, such as the presence of common
 bacterial cell components or inflamed tissue.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the foreign antigen is cleared, most effector cells die since they
 are no longer needed, but some differentiate into memory cells and remain
 alive indefinitely.
 Like naïve cells, memory cells respond to detection of their specific antigen
 by differentiating into effector cells, ready to fight an infection 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Murphy2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, the memory response to antigen is qualitatively different: memory
 cells are more sensitive to detection of their antigen, and a lower concentrati
on of antigen is suffiicient to activate them 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rogers2000,London2000,Berard2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In addition, memory cells are much less dependent on co-stimulation for
 activation: they can activate without certain co-stimulatory signals that
 are required by naïve cells, and the signals they do require are only required
 at lower levels in order to cause activation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "London2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, mechanisms that induce tolerance (non-response to antigen)
 in naïve cells are much less effective on memory cells 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "London2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Lastly, once activated, memory cells proliferate and differentiate into
 effector cells more quickly than naïve cells do 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Berard2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In combination, these changes in lymphocyte behavior upon differentiation
 into memory cells account for the much quicker and stronger response of
 the immune system to subsequent exposure to a previously-encountered antigen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of a pathogenic infection, immune memory is a major advantage,
 allowing an organism to rapidly fight off a previously encountered pathogen
 much more quickly and effectively than the first time it was encountered
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Murphy2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, if effector cells that recognize an antigen from an allograft
 are allowed to differentiate into memory cells, preventing rejection of
 the graft becomes much more difficult.
 Many immune suppression drugs work by interfering with the co-stimulation
 that naïve cells require in order to mount an immune response.
 Since memory cells do not require the same degree of co-stimulation, these
 drugs are not effective at suppressing an immune response that is mediated
 by memory cells.
 Secondly, because memory cells are able to mount a stronger and faster
 response to an antigen, all else being equal stronger immune suppression
 is required to prevent an immune response mediated by memory cells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, immune suppression affects the entire immune system, not just cells
 recognizing a specific antigen, so increasing the dosage of immune suppression
 drugs also increases the risk of complications from a compromised immune
 system, such as opportunistic infections 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Murphy2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 While the differences in cell surface markers between naïve and memory
 cells have been fairly well characterized, the internal regulatory mechanisms
 that allow memory cells to respond more quickly and without co-stimulation
 are still poorly understood.
 In order to develop methods of immune suppression that either prevent the
 formation of memory cells or work more effectively against memory cells,
 a more complete understanding of the mechanisms of immune memory formation
 and regulation is required.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Linear models are a generalization of the

-test and ANOVA to arbitrarily complex experimental designs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 In a typical linear model, there is one dependent variable observation
 per sample and a large number of samples.
 For example, in a linear model of height as a function of age and sex,
 there is one height measurement per person.
 However, when analyzing genomic data, each sample consists of observations
 of thousands of dependent variables.
 For example, in a 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RNA-seq
\end_layout

\end_inset

 experiment, the dependent variables may be the count of 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RNA-seq
\end_layout

\end_inset

 reads for each annotated gene, and there are tens of thousands of genes
 in the human genome.
 Since many assays measure other things than gene expression, the abstract
 term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feature
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used to refer to each dependent variable being measured, which may include
 any genomic element, such as genes, promoters, peaks, enhancers, exons,
 etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest approach to analyzing such data would be to fit the same model
 independently to each feature.
 However, this is undesirable for most genomics data sets.
 Genomics assays like 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
HTS
\end_layout

\end_inset

 are expensive, and often the process of generating the samples is also
 quite expensive and time-consuming.
 This expense limits the sample sizes typically employed in genomics experiments
, so a typical genomic data set has far more features being measured than
 observations (samples) per feature.
 As a result, the statistical power of the linear model for each individual
 feature is likewise limited by the small number of samples.
 However, because thousands of features from the same set of samples are
 analyzed together, there is an opportunity to improve the statistical power
 of the analysis by exploiting shared patterns of variation across features.
 This is the core feature of 
\begin_inset Flex Code

, a linear modeling framework designed for genomic data.

 data, but it can also be used to analyze any other data for which linear
 modeling is appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The central challenge when fitting a linear model is to estimate the variance
 of the data accurately.
 Out of all parameters required to evaluate statistical significance of
 an effect, the variance is the most difficult to estimate when sample sizes
 are small.
 A single shared variance could be estimated for all of the features together,
 and this estimate would be very stable, in contrast to the individual feature
 variance estimates.
 However, this would require the assumption that all features have equal
 variance, which is known to be false for most genomic data sets (for example,
 some genes' expression is known to be more variable than others').
 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 offers a compromise between these two extremes by using a method called
 empirical Bayes moderation to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

squeeze
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the distribution of estimated variances toward a single common value that
 represents the variance of an average feature in the data (Figure

) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 While the individual feature variance estimates are not stable, the common
 variance estimate for the entire data set is quite stable, so using a combinati
on of the two yields a variance estimate for each feature with greater precision
 than the individual feature variances.
 The trade-off for this improvement is that squeezing each estimated variance
 toward the common value introduces some bias – the variance will be underestima
ted for features with high variance and overestimated for features with
 low variance.
 Essentially, 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
limma
\end_layout

\end_inset

 assumes that extreme variances are less common than variances close to
 the common value.
 The squeezed variance estimates from this empirical Bayes procedure are
 shown empirically to yield greater statistical power than either the individual
 feature variances or the single common value.

 The reads in an

 the sampling process does not significantly affect the proportions.
 Under this assumption, a gene's read count in an

 sample is distributed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Binomial}(n,p)$

 is the total number of reads sequenced from the sample and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

 is the proportion of total fragments in the sample derived from that gene.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 is small, a

 Hence, if multiple sequencing runs are performed on the same

 If the abundance of a gene, 
\begin_inset Formula $p,$
\end_inset

 varies across biological replicates according to a gamma distribution,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 The assumption of a gamma distribution for the mixing weights is arbitrary,

 However, this test assumes the dispersion parameter is known exactly rather

 More recently, a quasi-likelihood test has been introduced that properly
 factors the uncertainty in dispersion estimation into the estimates of
 statistical significance, and this test is recommended over the likelihood

derived from DNA fragments that were bound by the immunoprecipitated protein.
 These are referred to as background reads.
 Biases in amplification and sequencing, as well as the aforementioned Poisson
 randomness of the sequencing itself, can cause fluctuations in the background
 level of reads that resemble peaks, and the true peaks must be distinguished
 from these.
 It is common to sequence the input DNA to the ChIP-seq reaction alongside
 the immunoprecipitated product in order to aid in estimating the fluctuations
 in background level across the genome.

There are generally two kinds of peaks that can be identified: narrow peaks
 and broadly enriched regions.
 Proteins that bind specific sites in the genome (such as many transcription
 factors) typically show most of their 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 read coverage at these specific sites and very little coverage anywhere
 else.
 Because the footprint of the protein is consistent wherever it binds, each
 peak has a consistent width, typically tens to hundreds of base pairs,
 representing the length of DNA that it binds to.
 Algorithms like

 In contrast, some proteins, chief among them histones, do not bind only
 at a small number of specific sites, but rather bind potentially almost
 everywhere in the entire genome.
 When looking at histone marks, adjacent histones tend to be similarly marked,
 and a given mark may be present on an arbitrary number of consecutive histones
 along the genome.

 The simplest case is

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RNA-seq

\end_inset

 in which read counts are obtained for a set of gene annotations, yielding
 a matrix of counts with rows representing genes and columns representing

 Because 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RNA-seq
\end_layout

 approximates a process of sampling from a population with replacement,
 each gene's count is only interpretable as a fraction of the total reads

 For that reason, 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\end_layout

\end_inset

 abundances are often reported as 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, if the abundance of a single gene increases, then in order
 for its fraction of the total reads to increase, all other genes' fractions
 must decrease to accommodate it.
 This effect is known as composition bias, and it is an artifact of the
 read sampling process that has nothing to do with the biology of the samples
 and must therefore be normalized out.
 The most commonly used methods to normalize for composition bias in 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 The effect of such normalizations is to center the distribution of

 at zero.
 Note that if a true global difference in gene expression is present in

 In other words,

 Briefly, a typical 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ChIP-seq
\end_layout

\end_inset

 sample has a bimodal distribution of read counts: a low-abundance mode
 representing background regions and a high-abundance mode representing
 signal regions.
 This offers two mutually incompatible normalization strategies: equalizing
 background coverage or equalizing signal coverage (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 If the experiment is well controlled and 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ChIP
\end_layout

\end_inset

 efficiency is known to be consistent across all samples, then normalizing
 the background coverage to be equal across all samples is a reasonable
 strategy.
 If this is not a safe assumption, then the preferred strategy is to normalize
 the signal regions in a way similar to 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 between samples.
 Beyond this, if a

status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 experiment has a more complicated structure that doesn't show the typical
 bimodal count distribution, it may be necessary to implement a normalization
 as a smooth function of abundance.
 However, this strategy makes a much stronger assumption about the data:
 that the average 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 is zero across all abundance levels.
 Hence, the simpler scaling normalization based on background or signal

ComBat and SVA for correction of known and unknown batch effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to well-understood effects that can be easily normalized out,
 a data set often contains confounding biological effects that must be accounted
 for in the modeling step.
 For instance, in an experiment with pre-treatment and post-treatment samples
 of cells from several different donors, donor variability represents a
 known batch effect.
 The most straightforward correction for known batches is to estimate the
 mean for each batch independently and subtract out the differences, so
 that all batches have identical means for each feature.
 However, as with variance estimation, estimating the differences in batch
 means is not necessarily robust at the feature level, so the ComBat method
 adds empirical Bayes squeezing of the batch mean differences toward a common
 value, analogous to 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\end_inset

's empirical Bayes squeezing of feature variance estimates 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Johnson2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Effectively, ComBat assumes that modest differences between batch means
 are real batch effects, but extreme differences between batch means are
 more likely to be the result of outlier observations that happen to line
 up with the batches rather than a genuine batch effect.
 The result is a batch correction that is more robust against outliers than
 simple subtraction of mean differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some data sets, unknown batch effects may be present due to inherent
 variability in the data, either caused by technical or biological effects.
 Examples of unknown batch effects include variations in enrichment efficiency
 between 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ChIP-seq
\end_layout

\end_inset

 samples, variations in populations of different cell types, and the effects
 of uncontrolled environmental factors on gene expression in humans or live
 animals.
 In an ordinary linear model context, unknown batch effects cannot be inferred
 and must be treated as random noise.
 However, in high-throughput experiments, once again information can be
 shared across features to identify patterns of un-modeled variation that
 are repeated in many features.
 One attractive strategy would be to perform 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
SVD
\end_layout

\end_inset

 on the matrix of linear model residuals (which contain all the un-modeled
 variation in the data) and take the first few singular vectors as batch
 effects.
 While this can be effective, it makes the unreasonable assumption that
 all batch effects are completely uncorrelated with any of the effects being
 modeled.
 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
SVA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 starts with this approach, but takes some additional steps to identify
 batch effects in the full data that are both highly correlated with the
 singular vectors in the residuals and least correlated with the effects
 of interest 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Leek2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Since the final batch effects are estimated from the full data, moderate
 correlations between the batch effects and effects of interest are allowed,
 which gives 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 much more freedom to estimate the true extent of the batch effects compared
 to simple residual

 Once the surrogate variables are estimated, they can be included as coefficient
s in the linear model in a similar fashion to known batch effects in order

When testing thousands of genes for differential expression or performing

 By construction, p-values have a

 This means that if all null hypotheses are true in a large number 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

\begin_inset Formula $T$

\begin_inset Formula $N*T$

 p-values would be called

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 at that threshold even though the null hypotheses are all true.
 These are called false discoveries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When only a fraction of null hypotheses are true, the p-value distribution
 will be a mixture of a uniform component representing the null hypotheses
 that are true and a non-uniform component representing the null hypotheses
 that are not true (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The fraction belonging to the uniform component is referred to as 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{0}$
\end_inset

, which ranges from 1 (all null hypotheses true) to 0 (all null hypotheses
 false).
 Furthermore, the non-uniform component must be biased toward zero, since
 any evidence against the null hypothesis pushes the p-value for a test
 toward zero.
 We can exploit this fact to estimate the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 for any significance threshold by estimating the degree to which the density
 of p-values left of that threshold exceeds what would be expected for a

\begin_layout Standard
Conversely, a p-value distribution that is neither uniform nor zero-biased
 is evidence of a modeling failure.
 Such a distribution would imply that there is less than zero evidence against
 the null hypothesis, which is not possible (in a frequentist setting).
 Attempting to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{0}$

 result.
 The usual cause of a poorly-behaving p-value distribution is a model assumption
 that is violated by the data, such as assuming equal variance between groups
 (homoskedasticity) when the variance of each group is not equal (heteroskedasti
city) or failing to model a strong confounding batch effect.
 In particular, such a p-value distribution is 
\emph on
not 
\emph default
consistent with a simple lack of signal in the data, as this should result
 in a uniform distribution.
 Hence, observing such a p-value distribution should prompt a search for
 violated model assumptions.

 After an infection is cleared, a subset of the naïve CD4
\begin_inset Formula $^{+}$
\end_inset

 T-cells that responded to that infection differentiate into memory CD4
\begin_inset Formula $^{+}$
\end_inset

 T-cells, which are responsible for responding to the same pathogen in the
 future.
 Memory CD4
\begin_inset Formula $^{+}$
\end_inset

 T-cells are functionally distinct, able to respond to an infection more
 quickly and without the co-stimulation required by naïve CD4
\begin_inset Formula $^{+}$
\end_inset

 T-cells.
 However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this functional distinction
 are not well-understood.
 Epigenetic regulation via histone modification is thought to play an important
 role, but while many studies have looked at static snapshots of histone
 methylation in T-cells, few studies have looked at the dynamics of histone
 regulation after T-cell activation, nor the differences in histone methylation
 between naïve and memory T-cells.
 H3K4me2, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 are three histone marks thought to be major
 epigenetic regulators of gene expression.
 The goal of the present study is to investigate the role of these histone
 marks in CD4
\begin_inset Formula $^{+}$
\end_inset

 T-cell activation kinetics and memory differentiation.
 In static snapshots, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 are often observed in the promoters
 of highly transcribed genes, while H3K27me3 is more often observed in promoters
 of inactive genes with little to no transcription occurring.
 As a result, the two H3K4 marks have been characterized as

\end_inset

 marks, while H3K27me3 has been characterized as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Despite these characterizations, the actual causal relationship between
 these histone modifications and gene transcription is complex and likely
 involves positive and negative feedback loops between the two.

In order to investigate the relationship between gene expression and these
 histone modifications in the context of naïve and memory CD4
\begin_inset Formula $^{+}$
\end_inset

 T-cell activation, a previously published data set of

\end_inset

 data and 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 data was re-analyzed using up-to-date methods designed to address the specific
 analysis challenges posed by this data set.
 The data set contains naïve and memory CD4
\begin_inset Formula $^{+}$
\end_inset

 T-cell samples in a time course before and after activation.
 Like the original analysis, this analysis looks at the dynamics of these
 histone marks and compares them to gene expression dynamics at the same
 time points during activation, as well as compares them between naïve and
 memory cells, in hope of discovering evidence of new mechanistic details
 in the interplay between them.
 The original analysis of this data treated each gene promoter as a monolithic
 unit and mostly assumed that 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ChIP-seq
\end_layout

\end_inset

 reads or peaks occurring anywhere within a promoter were equivalent, regardless
 of where they occurred relative to the gene structure.
 For an initial analysis of the data, this was a necessary simplifying assumptio
n.
 The current analysis aims to relax this assumption, first by directly analyzing
 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ChIP-seq
\end_layout

\end_inset

 peaks for differential modification, and second by taking a more granular
 look at the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 modifications relative to the gene's

 T-cells were isolated separately.
 Then cultures of both cells were activated with CD3/CD28 beads, and samples
 were taken at 4 time points: Day 0 (pre-activation), Day 1 (early activation),
 Day 5 (peak activation), and Day 14 (post-activation).
 For each combination of cell type and time point, RNA was isolated and
 sequenced, and

 some of the batch effect in the data

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to an error in sample preparation, the RNA from the samples for days
 0 and 5 were sequenced using a different kit than those for days 1 and
 14.
 This induced a substantial batch effect in the data due to differences
 in sequencing biases between the two kits, and this batch effect is unfortunate
ly confounded with the time point variable (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:RNA-PCA-no-batchsub"

 To do the best possible analysis with this data, this batch effect was
 subtracted out from the data using ComBat 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Johnson2007"

\end_inset

, ignoring the time point variable due to the confounding with the batch
 variable.
 The result is a marked improvement, but the unavoidable confounding with
 time point means that certain real patterns of gene expression will be
 indistinguishable from the batch effect and subtracted out as a result.
 Specifically, any

\end_inset

 pattern, such as a gene whose expression goes up on day 1, down on day
 5, and back up again on day 14, will be attenuated or eliminated entirely.
 In the context of a T-cell activation time course, it is unlikely that
 many genes of interest will follow such an expression pattern, so this
 loss was deemed an acceptable cost for correcting the batch effect.

Strand cross-correlation plots for ChIP-seq data, before and after blacklisting.
 
\series default
The number of reads starting at each position in the genome was counted
 separately for the plus and minus strands, and then the correlation coefficient
 between the read start counts for both strands (cross-correlation) was
 computed after shifting the plus strand counts forward by a specified interval
 (the delay).
 This was repeated for every delay value from 0 to 1000, and the cross-correlati
on values were plotted as a function of the delay.
 In good quality samples, cross-correlation is maximized when the delay
 equals the fragment size; in poor quality samples, cross-correlation is
 often maximized when the delay equals the read length, an artifactual peak
 whose cause is not fully understood.

 The batch effect has both a systematic component and a random noise component.
 While the systematic component was subtracted out using ComBat (Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:RNA-PCA"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), no such correction is possible for the noise component: Batch 1 simply
 has substantially more random noise in it, which reduces the statistical
 power for any differential expression tests involving samples in that batch.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the difficulty in detecting specific differentially expressed genes,
 there is still evidence that differential expression is present for these
 time points.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:rna-pca-final"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, there is a clear separation between naïve and memory samples at Day 0,
 despite the fact that only 2 genes were significantly differentially expressed
 for this comparison.
 Similarly, the small numbers of genes detected for the Day 0 vs Day 5 compariso
ns do not reflect the large separation between these time points in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This suggests that there is indeed a differential expression signal present
 in the data for these comparisons, but the large variability in the Batch
 1 samples obfuscates this signal at the individual gene level.
 As a result, it is impossible to make any meaningful statements about the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

size
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the gene signature for any time point, since the number of significant
 genes as well as the estimated number of differentially expressed genes
 depends so strongly on the variations in sample quality in addition to
 the size of the differential expression signal in the data.
 Gene-set enrichment analyses are similarly impractical.
 However, analyses looking at genome-wide patterns of expression are still
 practical.

 gives a summary of the peak calling statistics for each histone mark.
 Consistent with previous observations, all 3 histone marks occur in broad
 regions spanning many consecutive nucleosomes, rather than in sharp peaks
 as would be expected for a transcription factor or other molecule that
 binds to specific sites.
 This conclusion is further supported by Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:CCF-with-blacklist"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, in which a clear nucleosome-sized periodicity is visible in the cross-correlat
ion value for each sample, indicating that each time a given mark is present
 on one histone, it is also likely to be found on adjacent histones as well.
 H3K27me3 enrichment in particular is substantially more broad than either
 H3K4 mark, with a mean peak width of almost 19,000 bp.
 This is also reflected in the periodicity observed in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:CCF-with-blacklist"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, which remains strong much farther out for H3K27me3 than the other marks,
 showing H3K27me3 especially tends to be found on long runs of consecutive
 histones.

Gene expression and promoter histone methylation patterns show convergence
 between naïve and memory cells at day 14
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We hypothesized that if naïve cells had differentiated into memory cells
 by Day 14, then their patterns of expression and histone modification should
 converge with those of memory cells at Day 14.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:PCoA-promoters"

 shows the patterns of variation in all 3 histone marks in the promoter
 regions of the genome using 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\begin_layout Plain Layout
PCoA
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 All 3 marks show a noticeable convergence between the naïve and memory
 samples at day 14, visible as an overlapping of the day 14 groups on each
 plot.
 This is consistent with the counts of significantly differentially modified
 promoters and estimates of the total numbers of differentially modified
 promoters shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Number-signif-promoters"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 For all histone marks, evidence of differential modification between naïve
 and memory samples was detected at every time point except day 14.
 The day 14 convergence pattern is also present in the

\end_inset

), albeit in the 2nd and 3rd principal coordinates, indicating that it is
 not the most dominant pattern driving gene expression.
 Taken together, the data show that promoter histone methylation for these
 3 histone marks and RNA expression for naïve and memory cells are most
 similar at day 14, the furthest time point after activation.

 All the other clusters represent a continuum of peak positions relative
 to the

 In order from most upstream to most downstream, they are Clusters 6, 4,

 There do not appear to be any clusters representing coverage patterns other
 than lone peaks, such as coverage troughs or double peaks.
 Next, all promoters were plotted in a

 plot based on the same relative bin abundance data, and colored based on

 with no apparent separation between them, further supporting the conclusion
 that these clusters represent an arbitrary partitioning of a continuous
 distribution of promoter coverage landscapes.
 While the clusters are a useful abstraction that aids in visualization,
 they are ultimately not an accurate representation of the data.
 The continuous nature of the distribution also explains why different values
 of

 led to similar conclusions.

 Most genes in Cluster 5, the

 Taking this as the

Patterns of H3K27me3 promoter coverage associate with gene expression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike both H3K4 marks, whose main patterns of variation appear directly
 related to the size and position of a single peak within the promoter,
 the patterns of H3K27me3 methylation in promoters are more complex (Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 Once again looking at the relative coverage in a 500-bp wide bins in a
 5kb radius around each 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 (Figure

 This time, 3 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 of variation can be observed, each represented by 2 clusters with opposing
 patterns.
 The first axis is greater upstream coverage (Cluster 1) vs.
 greater downstream coverage (Cluster 3); the second axis is the coverage
 at the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 itself: peak (Cluster 4) or trough (Cluster 2); lastly, the third axis

\end_inset

 (Cluster 5) vs.
 downstream of the

 Referring to these opposing pairs of clusters as axes of variation is justified

, we can see that Clusters 1 and 2 are the only clusters with higher gene
 expression than the others.
 For Cluster 2, this is expected, since this cluster represents genes with
 depletion of H3K27me3 near the promoter.
 Hence, elevated expression in cluster 2 is consistent with the conventional
 view of H3K27me3 as a deactivating mark.
 However, Cluster 1, the cluster with the most elevated gene expression,
 represents genes with elevated coverage upstream of the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

, or equivalently, decreased coverage downstream, inside the gene body.
 The opposite pattern, in which H3K27me3 is more abundant within the gene
 body and less abundance in the upstream promoter region, does not show
 any elevation in gene expression.
 As with H3K4me2, this shows that the location of H3K27 trimethylation relative
 to the

 shows that H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 are all enriched near promoters,
 relative to the rest of the genome, consistent with their conventionally
 understood role in regulating gene transcription.
 Interestingly, the radius within this enrichment occurs is not the same
 for each histone mark.
 H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 are enriched within a 1
\begin_inset space ~

kbp radius, while H3K27me3 is enriched within 2.5
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

kbp.
 Notably, the determined promoter radius was consistent across all experimental
 conditions, varying only between different histone marks.
 This suggests that the conventional 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 approach of defining a single promoter region for each gene (or each 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

) and using that same promoter region for analyzing all types of genomic
 data within an experiment may not be appropriate, and a better approach
 may be to use a separate promoter radius for each kind of data, with each
 radius being derived from the data itself.
 Furthermore, the apparent asymmetry of upstream and downstream promoter
 histone modification with respect to gene expression, seen in Figures

 For H3K27me3, the correlation between histone modification near the promoter
 and gene expression is more complex, involving non-peak variations such
 as troughs in coverage at the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\end_layout

\end_inset

 and asymmetric coverage upstream and downstream, so it is difficult in
 this case to evaluate whether the 2.5

kbp radius determined from TSS-to-peak distances is functionally significant.
 However, the two patterns of coverage associated with elevated expression
 levels both have interesting features within this radius.

 across all histone marks and gene expression.
 This is consistent with the expectation that any naïve CD4
\begin_inset Formula $^{+}$
\end_inset

 T-cells remaining at day 14 should have differentiated into memory cells
 by that time, and should therefore have a genomic and epigenomic state
 similar to memory cells.
 This convergence is evidence that these histone marks all play an important
 role in the naïve-to-memory differentiation process.
 A histone mark that was not involved in naïve-to-memory differentiation
 would not be expected to converge in this way after activation.

 For H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, the pattern was straightforward: the consistent

 There were no obvious

 The association with gene expression was also straightforward: peaks closer

 Coverage downstream of the

In addition to simply making it easier to organize the steps in the analysis,
 structuring the analysis as a workflow allowed for some analysis strategies
 that would not have been practical otherwise.
 For example, 5 different

 quantification methods were tested against two different reference transcriptom

\end_layout

\end_inset

 data.
 These were then compared against each other in the exploratory data analysis
 step, to determine that the results were not very sensitive to either the
 choice of quantification method or the choice of annotation.
 This was possible with a single script for the exploratory data analysis,
 because Snakemake was able to automate running this script for every combinatio
n of method and reference.
 In a similar manner, two different peak calling methods were tested against
 each other, and in this case it was determined that 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 was unambiguously superior to

 Second, we searched for evidence that the relative

\begin_layout Subsection
Improve on the idea of an effective promoter radius
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study introduced the concept of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

effective promoter radius
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 specific to each histone mark based on distance from the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
TSS
\end_layout

\end_inset

 within which an excess of peaks was called for that mark.
 This concept was then used to guide further analyses throughout the study.
 However, while the effective promoter radius was useful in those analyses,
 it is both limited in theory and shown in practice to be a possible oversimplif
ication.
 First, the effective promoter radii used in this study were chosen based
 on manual inspection of the TSS-to-peak distance distributions in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:near-promoter-peak-enrich"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, selecting round numbers of analyst convenience (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:effective-promoter-radius"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 It would be better to define an algorithm that selects a more precise radius
 based on the features of the graph.
 One possible way to do this would be to randomly rearrange the called peaks
 throughout the genome many (while preserving the distribution of peak widths)
 and re-generate the same plot as in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:near-promoter-peak-enrich"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 This would yield a better 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

background
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 distribution that demonstrates the degree of near-TSS enrichment that would
 be expected by random chance.
 The effective promoter radius could be defined as the point where the true
 distribution diverges from the randomized background distribution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, the above definition of effective promoter radius has the significa
nt limitation of being based on the peak calling method.
 It is thus very sensitive to the choice of peak caller and significance
 threshold for calling peaks, as well as the degree of saturation in the
 sequencing.
 Calling peaks from 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ChIP-seq
\end_layout

\end_inset

 samples with insufficient coverage depth, with the wrong peak caller, or
 with a different significance threshold could give a drastically different
 number of called peaks, and hence a drastically different distribution
 of peak-to-TSS distances.
 To address this, it is desirable to develop a better method of determining
 the effective promoter radius that relies only on the distribution of read
 coverage around the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
TSS
\end_layout

\end_inset

, independent of the peak calling.
 Furthermore, as demonstrated by the upstream-downstream asymmetries observed
 in Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:H3K4me2-neighborhood"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:H3K27me3-neighborhood"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, this definition should determine a different radius for the upstream and
 downstream directions.
 At this point, it may be better to rename this concept 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

effective promoter extent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and avoid the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

radius
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, since a radius implies a symmetry about the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\end_layout

\end_inset

 that is not supported by the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beyond improving the definition of effective promoter extent, functional
 validation is necessary to show that this measure of near-TSS enrichment
 has biological meaning.

\end_inset

 already provide a very limited functional validation of the chosen promoter
 extents for H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 by showing that spikes in coverage within
 this region are most strongly correlated with elevated gene expression.
 However, there are other ways to show functional relevance of the promoter
 extent.
 For example, correlations could be computed between read counts in peaks
 nearby gene promoters and the expression level of those genes, and these
 correlations could be plotted against the distance of the peak upstream
 or downstream of the gene's 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
TSS
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 If the promoter extent truly defines a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sphere of influence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 within which a histone mark is involved with the regulation of a gene,
 then the correlations for peaks within this extent should be significantly
 higher than those further upstream or downstream.
 Peaks within these extents may also be more likely to show differential
 modification than those outside genic regions of the genome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Design experiments to focus on post-activation convergence of naïve & memory
 cells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, a convergence between naïve and memory cells was observed
 in both the pattern of gene expression and in epigenetic state of the 3
 histone marks studied, consistent with the hypothesis that any naïve cells
 remaining 14 days after activation have differentiated into memory cells,
 and that both gene expression and these histone marks are involved in this
 differentiation.
 However, the current study was not designed with this specific hypothesis
 in mind, and it therefore has some deficiencies with regard to testing
 it.
 The memory CD4
\begin_inset Formula $^{+}$
\end_inset

 samples at day 14 do not resemble the memory samples at day 0, indicating
 that in the specific model of activation used for this experiment, the
 cells are not guaranteed to return to their original pre-activation state,
 or perhaps this process takes substantially longer than 14 days.
 This difference is expected, as the cell cultures in this experiment were
 treated with IL2 from day 5 onward 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LaMere2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, so the signalling environments in which the cells are cultured are different
 at day 0 and day 14.
 This is a challenge for testing the convergence hypothesis because the
 ideal comparison to prove that naïve cells are converging to a resting
 memory state would be to compare the final naïve time point to the Day
 0 memory samples, but this comparison is only meaningful if memory cells
 generally return to the same 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

resting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 state that they started at.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because pre-culture and post-culture cells will probably never behave identicall
y even if they both nominally have a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

resting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 phenotype, a different experiment should be designed in which post-activation
 naive cells are compared to memory cells that were cultured for the same
 amount of time but never activated, in addition to post-activation memory
 cells.
 If the convergence hypothesis is correct, both post-activation cultures
 should converge on the culture of never-activated memory cells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, if naïve-to-memory convergence is a general pattern, it should
 also be detectable in other epigenetic marks, including other histone marks
 and DNA methylation.
 An experiment should be designed studying a large number of epigenetic
 marks known or suspected to be involved in regulation of gene expression,
 assaying all of these at the same pre- and post-activation time points.
 Multi-dataset factor analysis methods like 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 can then be used to identify coordinated patterns of regulation shared
 across many epigenetic marks.

 The chosen analysis strategy used a clustering approach, but this approach

 In light of this, a better means of dimension reduction for promoter landscape
 data is required.
 In the case of H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, one option is to define the first 3

Another weakness in the current analysis is the normalization of the average
 abundance of each promoter to an average of zero.
 This allows the abundance value in each window to represent the relative
 abundance of that window compared to all the other windows in the interrogated
 area.
 However, while using the remainder of the windows to set the

\begin_layout Subsection
Investigate causes of high correlation between mutually exclusive histone
 marks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The high correlation between coverage depth observed between H3K4me2 and
 H3K4me3 is both expected and unexpected.
 Since both marks are associated with elevated gene transcription, a positive
 correlation between them is not surprising.
 However, these two marks represent different post-translational modifications
 of the 
\emph on
same
\emph default
 lysine residue on the histone H3 polypeptide, which means that they cannot
 both be present on the same H3 subunit.
 Thus, the high correlation between them has several potential explanations.
 One possible reason is cell population heterogeneity: perhaps some genomic
 loci are frequently marked with H3K4me2 in some cells, while in other cells
 the same loci are marked with H3K4me3.
 Another possibility is allele-specific modifications: the loci are marked
 in each diploid cell with H3K4me2 on one allele and H3K4me3 on the other
 allele.
 Lastly, since each histone octamer contains 2 H3 subunits, it is possible
 that having one H3K4me2 mark and one H3K4me3 mark on a given histone octamer
 represents a distinct epigenetic state with a different function than either
 double H3K4me2 or double H3K4me3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hypothesis of allele-specific histone modification can easily be tested
 with existing data by locating all heterozygous loci occurring within both
 H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 peaks and checking for opposite allelic imbalance between
 H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 read at each locus.
 If the allele fractions in the reads from the two histone marks for each
 locus are plotted against each other, there should be a negative correlation.
 If no such negative correlation is found, then allele-specific histone
 modification is unlikely to be the reason for the high correlation between
 these histone marks.

Proper pre-processing is essential for array data

\begin_layout Standard
Microarrays, bead arrays, and similar assays produce raw data in the form
 of fluorescence intensity measurements, with each intensity measurement
 proportional to the abundance of some fluorescently labelled target DNA
 or RNA sequence that base pairs to a specific probe sequence.
 However, the fluorescence measurements for each probe are also affected
 my many technical confounding factors, such as the concentration of target
 material, strength of off-target binding, the sensitivity of the imaging
 sensor, and visual artifacts in the image.
 Some array designs also use multiple probe sequences for each target.
 Hence, extensive pre-processing of array data is necessary to normalize
 out the effects of these technical factors and summarize the information
 from multiple probes to arrive at a single usable estimate of abundance
 or other relevant quantity, such as a ratio of two abundances, for each
 target

\begin_layout Standard
The choice of pre-processing algorithms used in the analysis of an array
 data set can have a large effect on the results of that analysis.
 However, despite their importance, these steps are often neglected or rushed
 in order to get to the more scientifically interesting analysis steps involving
 the actual biology of the system under study.
 Hence, it is often possible to achieve substantial gains in statistical
 power, model goodness-of-fit, or other relevant performance measures, by
 checking the assumptions made by each preprocessing step and choosing specific
 normalization methods tailored to the specific goals of the current analysis.

Clinical diagnostic applications for microarrays require single-channel

 in using genomic assays for diagnostic purposes, such as distinguishing

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, is not applicable in a clinical setting.
 Two of the steps in 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RMA
\end_layout

\end_inset

, quantile normalization and probe summarization by median polish, depend
 on every array in the data set being normalized.
 This means that adding or removing any arrays from a data set changes the
 normalized values for all arrays, and data sets that have been normalized
 separately cannot be compared to each other.
 Hence, when using 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RMA
\end_layout

\end_inset

, any arrays to be analyzed together must also be normalized together, and
 the set of arrays included in the data set must be held constant throughout
 an analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These limitations present serious impediments to the use of arrays as a
 diagnostic tool.
 When training a classifier, the samples to be classified must not be involved
 in any step of the training process, lest their inclusion bias the training
 process.
 Once a classifier is deployed in a clinical setting, the samples to be
 classified will not even 
\emph on
exist
\emph default
 at the time of training, so including them would be impossible even if
 it were statistically justifiable.
 Therefore, any machine learning application for microarrays demands that
 the normalized expression values computed for an array must depend only
 on information contained within that array.
 This would ensure that each array's normalization is independent of every
 other array, and that arrays normalized separately can still be compared
 to each other without bias.
 Such a normalization is commonly referred to as

 allowing each array to be normalized independently of all others 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Quantile normalization is performed against a pre-generated set of quantiles

 intensities, using inverse variance weights learned from the same public

 The result is a normalization that satisfies the requirements mentioned

Heteroskedasticity must be accounted for in methylation array data 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DNA methylation arrays are a relatively new kind of assay that uses microarrays
 to measure the degree of methylation on cytosines in specific regions arrayed
 across the genome.
 First, bisulfite treatment converts all unmethylated cytosines to uracil
 (which are read as thymine during amplification and sequencing) while leaving
 methylated cytosines unaffected.
 Then, each target region is interrogated with two probes: one binds to
 the original genomic sequence and interrogates the level of methylated
 DNA, and the other binds to the same sequence with all cytosines replaced
 by thymidines and interrogates the level of unmethylated DNA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After normalization, these two probe intensities are summarized in one of
 two ways, each with advantages and disadvantages.

values, interpreted as fraction of DNA copies methylated, range from 0 to

 β

values are conceptually easy to interpret, but the constrained range makes
 them unsuitable for linear modeling, and their error distributions are
 highly non-normal, which also frustrates linear modeling.

However, the steep slope of the sigmoid transformation near 0 and 1 tends
 to over-exaggerate small differences in β values near those extremes, which
 in turn amplifies the error in those values, leading to a U-shaped trend
 in the mean-variance curve: extreme values have higher variances than values
 near the middle.
 This mean-variance dependency must be accounted for when fitting the linear
 model for differential methylation, or else the variance will be systematically
 overestimated for probes with moderate

 This is particularly undesirable for methylation data because the intermediate

 mean-variance relationship – it only assumes that the relationship can
 be modeled as a smooth curve.
 Hence, the method is sufficiently general to model the mean-variance relationsh
ip in methylation array data.
 However, while the method does not require count data as input, the standard
 implementation of voom assumes that the input is given in raw read counts,

For demonstrating the problem with separate normalization of training and
 validation data, one additional normalization was performed: the internal
 and external sets were each normalized separately using

 no further attempts at normalizing between the two sets.
 This represents approximately how

 Separate vectors were created for two types of samples: kidney graft biopsy
 samples and blood samples from graft recipients.
 For training, 341 kidney biopsy samples from 2 data sets and 965 blood
 samples from 5 data sets were used as the reference set.
 Arrays were groups into batches based on unique combinations of sample
 type (blood or biopsy), diagnosis (TX, AR, etc.), data set, and scan date.
 Thus, each batch represents arrays of the same kind that were run together
 on the same day.
 For estimating the probe inverse variance weights, frmaTools requires equal-siz
ed batches, which means a batch size must be chosen, and then batches smaller
 than that size must be ignored, while batches larger than the chosen size
 must be downsampled.
 This downsampling is performed randomly, so the sampling process is repeated
 5 times and the resulting normalizations are compared to each other.

 As expected, separate normalization biases the classifier probabilities,
 resulting in several misclassifications.

 vectors was created.
 First, an appropriate batch size was chosen by looking at the number of
 batches and number of samples included as a function of batch size (Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:frmatools-batch-size"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 For a given batch size, all batches with fewer samples that the chosen
 size must be ignored during training, while larger batches must be randomly
 downsampled to the chosen size.
 Hence, the number of samples included for a given batch size equals the
 batch size times the number of batches with at least that many samples.
 From Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:batch-size-samples"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, it is apparent that a batch size of 8 maximizes the number of samples
 included in training.
 Increasing the batch size beyond this causes too many smaller batches to
 be excluded, reducing the total number of samples for both tissue types.
 However, a batch size of 8 is not necessarily optimal.
 The article introducing frmaTools concluded that it was highly advantageous
 to use a smaller batch size in order to include more batches, even at the
 cost of including fewer total samples in training 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McCall2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 To strike an appropriate balance between more batches and more samples,
 a batch size of 5 was chosen.
 For both blood and biopsy samples, this increased the number of batches
 included by 10, with only a modest reduction in the number of samples compared
 to a batch size of 8.
 With a batch size of 5, 26 batches of biopsy samples and 46 batches of
 blood samples were available.

Since

 training requires equal-size batches, larger batches are downsampled randomly.
 This introduces a nondeterministic step in the generation of normalization
 vectors.
 To show that this randomness does not substantially change the outcome,
 the random downsampling and subsequent vector learning was repeated 5 times,
 with a different random seed each time.

 and the standard deviation calculated for each probe in the methylation
 array data set.
 A few features of the data are apparent.
 First, the data are very strongly bimodal, with peaks in the density around
 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term (pl)
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
M-value
\end_layout

\end_inset

 of +4 and -4.
 These modes correspond to methylation sites that are nearly 100% methylated
 and nearly 100% unmethylated, respectively.
 The strong bimodality indicates that a majority of probes interrogate sites
 that fall into one of these two categories.
 The points in between these modes represent sites that are either partially
 methylated in many samples, or are fully methylated in some samples and
 fully unmethylated in other samples, or some combination.
 The next visible feature of the data is the W-shaped variance trend.
 The upticks in the variance trend on either side are expected, based on
 the sigmoid transformation exaggerating small differences at extreme 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term (pl)

\begin_layout Plain Layout
M-value
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 However, the uptick in the center is interesting: it indicates that sites
 that are not constitutively methylated or unmethylated have a higher variance.
 This could be a genuine biological effect, or it could be spurious noise
 that is only observable at sites with varying methylation.

, we see the mean-variance trend for the same methylation array data, this
 time with surrogate variables and sample quality weights estimated from
 the data and included in the model.
 As expected, the overall average variance is smaller, since the surrogate
 variables account for some of the variance.
 In addition, the uptick in variance in the middle of the

 The result is a nearly flat variance trend for the entire intermediate

 by the surrogate variables and remains in the plot, indicating that this

 As expected, the weights exactly counteract the trend in the data, resulting
 in a nearly flat trend centered vertically at 1 (i.e.
 0 on the log scale).
 This shows that the observations with extreme 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term (pl)

 In turn, this gives relatively more weight to observations in the middle
 region, which are more likely to correspond to probes measuring interesting
 biology (not constitutively methylated or unmethylated).

To determine whether any of the known experimental factors had an impact

 Diabetes diagnosis was found to have a potentially significant association
 with the sample weights, with a t-test p-value of

 As expected, the more elaborate analyses, B and C, report more significant
 probes than the more basic analysis A, consistent with the conclusions
 above that the data contain hidden systematic variations that must be modeled.
 Table

 This was computed by estimating the proportion of null hypotheses that
 were true using the method of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 and subtracting that fraction from the total number of probes, yielding
 an estimate of the number of null hypotheses that are false based on the
 distribution of p-values across the entire dataset.
 Note that this does not identify which null hypotheses should be rejected
 (i.e.
 which probes are significant); it only estimates the true number of such
 probes.
 Once again, analyses B and C result it much larger estimates for the number
 of differentially methylated probes.
 In this case, analysis C, the only analysis that includes voom, estimates
 the largest number of differentially methylated probes for all 3 contrasts.
 If the assumptions of all the methods employed hold, then this represents
 a gain in statistical power over the simpler analysis A.

 The distributions for analysis A all have a dip in density near zero, which
 is a strong sign of a poor model fit.
 The histograms for analyses B and C are more well-behaved, with a uniform
 component stretching all the way from 0 to 1 representing the probes for
 which the null hypotheses is true (no differential methylation), and a
 zero-biased component representing the probes for which the null hypothesis
 is false (differentially methylated).
 These histograms do not indicate any major issues with the model fit.

\begin_layout Subsection
fRMA achieves clinically applicable normalization without sacrificing classifica
tion performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Classifier-probabilities-RMA"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, improper normalization, particularly separate normalization of training
 and test samples, leads to unwanted biases in classification.
 In a controlled experimental context, it is always possible to correct
 this issue by normalizing all experimental samples together.
 However, because it is not feasible to normalize all samples together in
 a clinical context, a single-channel normalization is required.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The major concern in using a single-channel normalization is that non-single-cha
nnel methods can share information between arrays to improve the normalization,
 and single-channel methods risk sacrificing the gains in normalization
 accuracy that come from this information sharing.
 In the case of 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RMA
\end_layout

\end_inset

, this information sharing is accomplished through quantile normalization
 and median polish steps.
 The need for information sharing in quantile normalization can easily be
 removed by learning a fixed set of quantiles from external data and normalizing
 each array to these fixed quantiles, instead of the quantiles of the data
 itself.
 As long as the fixed quantiles are reasonable, the result will be similar
 to standard 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RMA
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 However, there is no analogous way to eliminate cross-array information
 sharing in the median polish step, so 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
fRMA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 replaces this with a weighted average of probes on each array, with the
 weights learned from external data.
 This step of 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
fRMA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 has the greatest potential to diverge from RMA in undesirable ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, when run on real data, 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
fRMA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 performed at least as well as 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RMA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in both the internal validation and external validation tests.
 This shows that 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
fRMA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 can be used to normalize individual clinical samples in a class prediction
 context without sacrificing the classifier performance that would be obtained
 by using the more well-established 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RMA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for normalization.
 The other single-channel normalization method considered, 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
SCAN
\end_layout

\end_inset

, showed some loss of 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
AUC
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in the external validation test.
 Based on these results, 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
fRMA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is the preferred normalization for clinical samples in a class prediction
 context.

The published

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 normalization vectors for the hgu133plus2 platform were generated from
 a set of 850 samples chosen from a wide range of tissues, which the authors
 determined was sufficient to generate a robust set of normalization vectors
 that could be applied across all tissues 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "McCall2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Since we only had hthgu133pluspm for 2 tissues of interest, our needs were
 more modest.
 Even using only 130 samples in 26 batches of 5 samples each for kidney
 biopsies, we were able to train a robust set of 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
fRMA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 normalization vectors that were not meaningfully affected by the random
 selection of 5 samples from each batch.
 As expected, the training process was just as robust for the blood samples
 with 230 samples in 46 batches of 5 samples each.
 Because these vectors were each generated using training samples from a
 single tissue, they are not suitable for general use, unlike the vectors
 provided with 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 itself.
 They are purpose-built for normalizing a specific type of sample on a specific
 platform.
 This is a mostly acceptable limitation in the context of developing a machine
 learning classifier for diagnosing a disease from samples of a specific
 tissue.

\begin_layout Subsection
Methylation array data can be successfully analyzed using existing techniques,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both analysis strategies B and C both yield a reasonable analysis, with
 a mean-variance trend that matches the expected behavior for the non-linear

 transformation (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:meanvar-sva-aw"
plural "false"

\end_inset

) and well-behaved p-value distributions (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:meth-p-value-histograms"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 These two analyses also yield similar numbers of significant probes (Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:methyl-num-signif"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) and similar estimates of the number of differentially methylated probes
 (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:methyl-est-nonnull"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The main difference between these two analyses is the method used to account
 for the mean-variance trend.
 In analysis B, the trend is estimated and applied at the probe level: each
 probe's estimated variance is squeezed toward the trend using an empirical
 Bayes procedure (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:meanvar-sva-aw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 In analysis C, the trend is still estimated at the probe level, but instead
 of estimating a single variance value shared across all observations for
 a given probe, the voom method computes an initial estimate of the variance
 for each observation individually based on where its model-fitted 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
M-value
\end_layout

\end_inset

 falls on the trend line and then assigns inverse-variance weights to model
 the difference in variance between observations.
 An overall variance is still estimated for each probe using the same empirical
 Bayes method, but now the residual trend is flat (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:meanvar-sva-voomaw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), indicating that the mean-variance trend is adequately modeled by scaling
 the estimated variance for each observation using the weights computed
 by voom.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difference between the standard empirical Bayes trended variance modeling
 (analysis B) and voom (analysis C) is analogous to the difference between
 a t-test with equal variance and a t-test with unequal variance, except
 that the unequal group variances used in the latter test are estimated
 based on the mean-variance trend from all the probes rather than the data
 for the specific probe being tested, thus stabilizing the group variance
 estimates by sharing information between probes.
 Allowing voom to model the variance using observation weights in this manner
 allows the linear model fit to concentrate statistical power where it will
 do the most good.
 For example, if a particular probe's 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term (pl)
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 are always at the extreme of the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 samples, but the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term (pl)

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\end_inset

 samples are within the flat region of the mean-variance trend (between
 
\begin_inset Formula $-3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $+3$
\end_inset

), voom is able to down-weight the contribution of the high-variance 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term (pl)

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 from the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 samples in order to gain more statistical power while testing for differential
 methylation between

\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 In contrast, modeling the mean-variance trend only at the probe level would
 combine the high-variance

\end_inset

 samples and lower-variance samples from other conditions and estimate an
 intermediate variance for this probe.
 In practice, analysis B shows that this approach is adequate, but the voom
 approach in analysis C performs at least as well on all model fit criteria
 and yields a larger estimate for the number of differentially methylated
 genes,

 This dysregulation could easily manifest as a greater degree of variation
 in the DNA methylation patterns of affected tissues.
 In contrast, 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 has a more specific cause and effect, so a less variable methylation signature

This preliminary analysis suggests that some degree of differential methylation

 and each of the three types of transplant disfunction studied.
 Hence, it may be feasible to train a classifier to diagnose transplant

 However, the major importance of both 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 and sample quality weighting for proper modeling of this data poses significant
 challenges for any attempt at a machine learning on data of similar quality.
 While these are easily used in a modeling context with full sample information,
 neither of these methods is directly applicable in a machine learning context,
 where the diagnosis is not known ahead of time.
 If a machine learning approach for methylation-based diagnosis is to be
 pursued, it will either require machine-learning-friendly methods to address
 the same systematic trends in the data that 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 and sample quality weighting address, or it will require higher quality

\begin_layout Standard
Because the tools for building

\end_inset

 normalization vectors require equal-size batches, many samples must be
 discarded from the training data.
 This is undesirable for a few reasons.
 First, more data is simply better, all other things being equal.
 In this case, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

better
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means a more precise estimate of normalization parameters.
 In addition, the samples to be discarded must be chosen arbitrarily, which
 introduces an unnecessary element of randomness into the estimation process.
 While the randomness can be made deterministic by setting a consistent
 random seed, the need for equal size batches also introduces a need for
 the analyst to decide on the appropriate trade-off between batch size and
 the number of batches.
 This introduces an unnecessary and undesirable 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

researcher degree of freedom
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into the analysis, since the generated normalization vectors now depend
 on the choice of batch size based on vague selection criteria and instinct,
 which can unintentionally introduce bias if the researcher chooses a batch
 size based on what seems to yield the most favorable downstream results

\begin_layout Standard
Fortunately, the requirement for equal-size batches is not inherent to the
 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
fRMA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 algorithm but rather a limitation of the implementation in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
frmaTools
\end_layout

\end_inset

 package.
 In personal communication, the package's author, Matthew McCall, has indicated
 that with some work, it should be possible to improve the implementation
 to work with batches of unequal sizes.
 The current implementation ignores the batch size when calculating with-batch
 and between-batch residual variances, since the batch size constant cancels
 out later in the calculations as long as all batches are of equal size.
 Hence, the calculations of these parameters would need to be modified to
 remove this optimization and properly calculate the variances using the
 full formula.
 Once this modification is made, a new strategy would need to be developed
 for assessing the stability of parameter estimates, since the random sub-sampli
ng step is eliminated, meaning that different sub-samplings can no longer
 be compared as in Figures

.
 Bootstrap resampling is likely a good candidate here: sample many training
 sets of equal size from the existing training set with replacement, estimate
 parameters from each resampled training set, and compare the estimated
 parameters between bootstraps in order to quantify the variability in each
 parameter's estimation.

Developing methylation arrays as a diagnostic tool for kidney transplant
 rejection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current study has showed that DNA methylation, as assayed by Illumina
 450k methylation arrays, has some potential for diagnosing transplant dysfuncti
ons, including rejection.
 However, very few probes could be confidently identified as differentially
 methylated between healthy and dysfunctional transplants.
 One likely explanation for this is the predominant influence of unobserved
 confounding factors.
 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
SVA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 can model and correct for such factors, but the correction can never be
 perfect, so some degree of unwanted systematic variation will always remain
 after 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
SVA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 correction.
 If the effect size of the confounding factors was similar to that of the
 factor of interest (in this case, transplant status), this would be an
 acceptable limitation, since removing most of the confounding factors'
 effects would allow the main effect to stand out.
 However, in this data set, the confounding factors have a much larger effect
 size than transplant status, which means that the small degree of remaining
 variation not removed by 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
SVA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 can still swamp the effect of interest, making it difficult to detect.
 This is, of course, a major issue when the end goal is to develop a classifier
 to diagnose transplant rejection from methylation data, since batch-correction
 methods like 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
SVA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 that work in a linear modeling context cannot be applied in a machine learning
 context.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, the source of these unwanted systematic variations in the data
 is unknown.
 The best solution would be to determine the cause of the variation and
 eliminate it, thereby eliminating the need to model and remove that variation.
 However, if this proves impractical, another option is to use 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
SVA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to identify probes that are highly associated with the surrogate variables
 that describe the unwanted variation in the data.
 These probes could be discarded prior to classifier training, in order
 to maximize the chance that the training algorithm will be able to identify
 highly predictive probes from those remaining.
 Lastly, it is possible that some of this unwanted variation is a result
 of the array-based assay being used and would be eliminated by switching
 to assaying DNA methylation using bisulphite sequencing.
 However, this carries the risk that the sequencing assay will have its
 own set of biases that must be corrected for in a different way.

 Globin reduction is a standard technique used to improve the expression
 results obtained by DNA microarrays on RNA from blood samples.
 However, with 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 reduction for

 Moreover, no off-the-shelf kits are available for globin reduction in nonhuman

\end_inset

 protocol approximately doubles the yield of informative (non-globin) reads
 by greatly reducing the fraction of globin reads, while also improving
 the consistency in sequencing depth between samples.
 The increased yield enables detection of about 2000 more genes, significantly
 increases the correlation in measured gene expression levels between samples,
 and increases the sensitivity of differential gene expression tests.

 In order to streamline the process of performing 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 on these blood samples, we developed a custom sequencing protocol.
 In the developement of this protocol, we required a solution for the problem
 of excess globin reads.
 High fractions of globin 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 are naturally present in mammalian peripheral blood samples (up to 70%
 of total

) and these are known to interfere with the results of array-based expression
 profiling 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Globin reduction is also necessary for 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 of blood samples, though for unrelated reasons: without globin reduction,
 many 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\end_inset

 reads will be derived from the globin genes, leaving fewer for the remainder
 of the genes in the transcriptome.
 However, existing strategies for globin reduction require an additional
 step during sample preparation to deplete the population of globin transcripts
 from the sample prior to reverse transcription

.
 Furthermore, off-the-shelf globin reduction kits are generally targeted
 at human or mouse globin, not cynomolgus monkey, and sequence identity
 between human and cyno globin genes cannot be automatically assumed.
 Hence, we sought to incorporate a custom globin reduction method into our

 A few artifacts in the cynomolgus genome annotation complicated read counting.
 First, no ortholog is annotated for alpha globin in the cynomolgus genome,
 presumably because the human genome has two alpha globin genes with nearly
 identical sequences, making the orthology relationship ambiguous.
 However, two loci in the cynomolgus genome are annotated as “hemoglobin
 subunit alpha-like” (LOC102136192 and LOC102136846).
 LOC102136192 is annotated as a pseudogene while LOC102136846 is annotated
 as protein-coding.
 Our globin reduction protocol was designed to include blocking of these
 two genes.
 Indeed, these two genes together have almost the same read counts in each
 library as the properly-annotated HBB gene and much larger counts than
 any other gene in the unblocked libraries, giving confidence that reads
 derived from the real alpha globin are mapping to both genes.
 Thus, reads from both of these loci were counted as alpha globin reads
 in all further analyses.
 The second artifact is a small, uncharacterized non-coding RNA gene (LOC1021365
91), which overlaps the HBA-like gene (LOC102136192) on the opposite strand.
 If counting is not performed in stranded mode (or if a non-strand-specific
 sequencing protocol is used), many reads mapping to the globin gene will
 be discarded as ambiguous due to their overlap with this

 gene, resulting in significant undercounting of globin reads.
 Therefore, stranded sense counts were used for all further analysis in
 the present study to insure that we accurately accounted for globin transcript
 reduction.
 However, we note that stranded reads are not necessary for

 The remaining reads either aligned to intergenic regions (that include
 long non-coding RNAs) or did not align with any annotated transcripts in

 In the

 Nonetheless, this degree of globin reduction is sufficient to nearly double
 the yield of useful reads.
 Thus,

 Un-normalized values are used here because the

 This is best seen in the percentage of non-globin reads as a fraction of

 Hence, the more consistent behavior of

 samples makes planning an experiment easier and more efficient because
 it eliminates the need to over-sequence every sample in order to guard
 against the worst case of a high-globin fraction.

Since

 yields more usable sequencing depth, it should also allow detection of
 more genes at any given threshold.
 When we looked at the distribution of average normalized 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
logCPM
\end_layout

\end_inset

 values across all libraries for genes with at least one read assigned to
 them, we observed the expected bimodal distribution, with a high-abundance
 "signal" peak representing detected genes and a low-abundance "noise" peak
 representing genes whose read count did not rise above the noise floor
 (Figure

 Consistent with the 2-fold increase in raw counts assigned to non-globin
 genes, the signal peak for 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\end_inset

 samples is shifted to the right relative to the non-GB signal peak.
 When all the samples are normalized together, this difference is normalized
 out, lining up the signal peaks, and this reveals that, as expected, the
 noise floor for the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 This greater separation between signal and noise peaks in the

 and more precisely quantified than in the non-GB samples.

 All reads in each sequencing library were aligned to the cyno genome, and
 the number of reads uniquely aligning to each gene was counted.
 Genes with zero counts in all libraries were discarded.
 Libraries were normalized using the TMM method.
 Libraries were split into GB and non-GB groups and the average logCPM was
 computed.
 The distribution of average gene logCPM values was plotted for both groups
 using a kernel density plot to approximate a continuous distribution.
 The GB logCPM distributions are marked in red, non-GB in blue.
 The black vertical line denotes the chosen detection threshold of

\begin_layout Standard
Based on these distributions, we selected a detection threshold of 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

, which is approximately the leftmost edge of the trough between the signal
 and noise peaks.
 This represents the most liberal possible detection threshold that doesn't
 call substantial numbers of noise genes as detected.
 Among the full dataset, 13429 genes were detected at this threshold, and
 22276 were not.
 When considering the

One potential worry is that the

 protocol could perturb the levels of non-globin genes.
 There are two kinds of possible perturbations: systematic and random.
 The former is not a major concern for detection of differential expression,
 since a 2-fold change in every sample has no effect on the relative fold
 change between samples.
 In contrast, random perturbations would increase the noise and obscure
 the signal in the dataset, reducing the capacity to detect differential
 expression.

The key point is that the

\end_inset

 data results in substantially more differentially expressed calls than
 the non-GB data.
 Since there is no gold standard for this dataset, it is impossible to be
 certain whether this is due to under-calling of differential expression
 in the non-GB samples or over-calling in the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
GB
\end_layout

\end_inset

 samples.
 However, given that both datasets are derived from the same biological
 samples and have nearly equal 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term (pl)
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
BCV
\end_layout

\end_inset

, it is more likely that the larger number of differential expression calls
 in the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 samples are genuine detections that were enabled by the higher sequencing
 depth and measurement precision of the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 samples.
 Note that the same set of genes was considered in both subsets, so the
 larger number of differentially expressed gene calls in the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original experience with whole blood gene expression profiling on DNA
 microarrays demonstrated that the high concentration of globin transcripts
 reduced the sensitivity to detect genes with relatively low expression
 levels, in effect, significantly reducing the sensitivity.
 To address this limitation, commercial protocols for globin reduction were
 developed based on strategies to block globin transcript amplification
 during labeling or physically removing globin transcripts by affinity bead
 methods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Winn2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 More recently, using the latest generation of labeling protocols and arrays,
 it was determined that globin reduction was no longer necessary to obtain
 sufficient sensitivity to detect differential transcript expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NuGEN2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, we are not aware of any publications using these currently available
 protocols with the latest generation of microarrays that actually compare
 the detection sensitivity with and without globin reduction.
 However, in practice this has now been adopted generally primarily driven
 by concerns for cost control.
 The main objective of our work was to directly test the impact of globin
 gene transcripts and a new 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\end_inset

 protocol for application to the newest generation of differential gene
 expression profiling determined using next generation sequencing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The challenge of doing global gene expression profiling in cynomolgus monkeys
 is that the current available arrays were never designed to comprehensively
 cover this genome and have not been updated since the first assemblies
 of the cynomolgus genome were published.
 Therefore, we determined that the best strategy for peripheral blood profiling
 was to perform deep 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RNA-seq
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and inform the workflow using the latest available genome assembly and
 annotation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Wilson2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, it was not immediately clear whether globin reduction was necessary
 for 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RNA-seq
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or how much improvement in efficiency or sensitivity to detect differential
 gene expression would be achieved for the added cost and effort.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Existing strategies for globin reduction involve degradation or physical
 removal of globin transcripts in a separate step prior to reverse transcription
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 This additional step adds significant time, complexity, and cost to sample
 preparation.
 Faced with the need to perform 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RNA-seq
\end_layout

\end_inset

 on large numbers of blood samples we sought a solution to globin reduction
 that could be achieved purely by adding additional reagents during the
 reverse transcription reaction.
 Furthermore, we needed a globin reduction method specific to cynomolgus
 globin sequences that would work an organism for which no kit is available
 off the shelf.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above, the addition of

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term (pl)

\end_inset

 has a very small impact on measured expression levels of gene expression.
 However, this is a non-issue for the purposes of differential expression
 testing, since a systematic change in a gene in all samples does not affect
 relative expression levels between samples.
 However, we must acknowledge that simple comparisons of gene expression
 data obtained by 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\end_inset

 and non-GB protocols are not possible without additional normalization.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More importantly, 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
GB
\end_layout

\end_inset

 not only nearly doubles the yield of usable reads, it also increases inter-samp
le correlation and sensitivity to detect differential gene expression relative
 to the same set of samples profiled without

.
 In addition, 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

\end_inset

 does not add a significant amount of random noise to the data.
 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term (Capital)

\end_layout

\end_inset

 thus represents a cost-effective and low-effort way to squeeze more data
 and statistical power out of the same blood samples and the same amount
 of sequencing.
 In conclusion, 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
GB

\end_inset

 greatly increases the yield of useful 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term

 reads mapping to the rest of the genome, with minimal perturbations in
 the relative levels of non-globin genes.
 Based on these results, globin transcript reduction using sequence-specific,

Future Directions

\begin_layout Standard
One drawback of the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
GB
\end_layout

\end_inset

 method presented in this analysis is a poor yield of genic reads, only
 around 50%.
 In a separate experiment, the reagent mixture was modified so as to address
 this drawback, resulting in a method that produces an even better reduction
 in globin reads without reducing the overall fraction of genic reads.
 However, the data showing this improvement consists of only a few test
 samples, so the larger data set analyzed above was chosen in order to demonstra
te the effectiveness of the method in reducing globin reads while preserving
 the biological signal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The motivation for developing a fast practical way to enrich for non-globin
 reads in cyno blood samples was to enable a large-scale

 These applications range from basic science to translational medicine,
 but in all cases, high-thoughput genomic assays were central to the results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Every high-throughput analysis presents unique analysis challenges
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, each of these applications of high-throughput genomic assays
 presented unique analysis challenges that could not be solved simply by
 stringing together standard off-the-shelf methods into a straightforward
 analysis pipeline.
 In every case, a bespoke analysis workflow tailored to the data was required,
 and in no case was it possible to determine every step in the workflow
 fully prior to seeing the data.
 For example, exploratory data analysis of the CD4
\begin_inset Formula $^{+}$
\end_inset

 T-cell 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RNA-seq
\end_layout

\end_inset

 data uncovered the batch effect, and the analysis was adjusted to compensate
 for it.
 Similarly, analysis of the 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ChIP-seq
\end_layout

\end_inset

 data required choosing an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

effective promoter radius
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 based on the data itself, and several different peak callers were tested
 before the correct choice became clear.
 In the development of custom 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
fRMA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 vectors, an appropriate batch size had to be chosen based on the properties
 of the training data.
 In the analysis of methylation array data, the appropriate analysis strategy
 was not obvious and was determined by trying several plausible strategies
 and inspecting the model paramters afterward to determine which strategy
 appeared to best capture the observed properties of the data and which
 strategies appeared to have systematic errors as a result of failing to
 capture those properties.
 The 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
GB
\end_layout

\end_inset

 protocol went through several rounds of testing before satisfactory performance
 was achieved, and as mentioned, optimization of protocol has continued
 past the version described here.
 These are only a few examples out of many instances of analysis decisions
 motivated by the properties of the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Successful data analysis requires a toolbox, not a pipeline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multiple times throughout this work, I have attempted to construct standard,
 reusable, pipelines for analysis of specific kinds of data, such as 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RNA-seq
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ChIP-seq
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Each time, the very next data set containing this data broke one or more
 of the assumptions I had built into the pipeline, such as an RNA-seq dataset
 where some samples aligned to the sense strand while others aligned to
 the antisense strand, or the discovery that the effective promoter radius
 varies by histone mark.
 Each violation of an assumption required a significant rewrite of the pipeline'
s code in order to accommodate the new aspect of the data.
 The prospect of reusability turned out to be a pipe(line) dream.
 After several attempts to extend my pipelines to be general enough to handle
 an ever-increasing variety of data idiosyncrasies, I realized that it was
 actually 
\emph on
less
\emph default
 work to reimplement an analysis workflow from scratch each time rather
 than try to adapt an existing workflow that was originally designed for
 a different data set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once I embraced the idea of writing a bespoke analysis workflow for every
 data set instead of a one-size-fits-all pipeline, I stopped thinking of
 the pipeline as the atomic unit of analysis.
 Instead, I focused on developing an understanding of the component parts
 of each pipeline, which problems each part solves, and what assumptions
 it makes, so that when I was presented with a new data set, I could quickly
 select the appropriate analysis methods for that data set and compose them
 into a new workflow to answer the demands of a new data set.
 In cases where no off-the-shelf method existed to address a specific aspect
 of the data, knowing about a wide range of analysis methods allowed me
 to select the one that was closest to what I needed and adapt it accordingly,
 even if it was not originally designed to handle the kind of data I was
 analyzing.
 For example, when analyzing heteroskedastic methylation array data, I adapted
 the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
voom
\end_layout

\end_inset

 method from 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
limma
\end_layout

\end_inset

, which was originally designed to model heteroskedasticity in 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
RNA-seq
\end_layout

\end_inset

data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Law2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 While 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
voom
\end_layout

\end_inset

 was designed to accept read counts, I determined that this was not a fundamenta
l assumption of the method but rather a limitation of the specific implementatio
n, and I was able to craft a modified implementation that accepted 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term (pl)
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 from methylation arrays.
 In contrast, adapting something like 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
edgeR
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for methylation arrays would not be possible, since many steps of the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
edgeR
\end_layout

\end_inset

 workflow, from normalization to dispersion estimation to model fitting,
 assume that the input is given on the scale of raw counts and take full
 advantage of this assumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Robinson2010,Robinson2010a,McCarthy2012,Chen2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In short, I collected a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

toolbox
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 full of useful modular analysis methods and developed the knowledge of
 when and where each could be applied, as well as how to compose them on
 demand into pipelines for specific data sets.
 This prepared me to handle the idiosyncrasies of any new data set, even
 when the new data has problems that I have not previously encountered in
 any other data set.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reusable pipelines have their place, but that place is in automating established
 processes, not researching new science.
 For example, the custom 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
fRMA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 vectors developed in Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Improving-array-based-diagnostic"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, are being incorporated into an automated pipeline for diagnosing transplant
 rejection using biopsy and blood samples from transplant recipients.
 Once ready, this diagnostic method will consist of normalization using
 the pre-trained 
\begin_inset Flex Glossary Term
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
fRMA
\end_layout

\end_inset

 vectors, followed by classification of the sample by a pre-trained classifier,
 which outputs a posterior probability of acute rejection.
 This is a perfect use case for a proper pipeline: repeating the exact same
 sequence of analysis steps many times.
 The input to the pipeline is sufficiently well-controlled that we can guarantee
 it will satisfy the assumptions of the pipeline.
 But research data is not so well-controlled, so when analyzing data in
 a research context, the analysis must conform to the data, rather than
 trying to force the data to conform to a preferred analysis strategy.
 That means having a toolbox full of composable methods ready to respond
 to the observed properties of the data.
