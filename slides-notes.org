* Notes from lab meeting practice run

** DONE Mechanical issues
- [X] Blurry slide changes
  - Solution: use Acrobat for presenting
- [X] Use widescreen aspect ratio -- option to show 2 figures side by
  side
- [X] Header is hard to read/easy to ignore because of color scheme.
  Consider dark text on white bg instead.
- [X] No figure numbers
- [X] No chapter numbers, just "3 parts"
- [X] Way to display speaker notes alongside slides? Maybe import into
  PPT?
  - https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#speaker-notes

** TODO Presentation issues
- [X] Bigger axis labels
- [X] Better cluster ordering, labeling, and transpose violin plots
  for consistency
- [X] Whenever possible: micro first to introduce the plot, then macro
  to show the full plot
- [ ] For PCoA plots, show just one donor at a time first to show
  the trend in a simpler context

** TODO Content issues
- [X] Maybe show more preprocessing, batch correction, etc.
- [X] Tie conclusions back to intro, add future directions
- [X] Intro slide for MOFA: how and why
- [X] Too many bullet points. Don't need to write everything I say.
  Move to speaker notes.
- [X] Intro the histone marks and why we picked them
- [X] Brief 30 second intro to RNA-seq & ChIP-seq
- [X] Rephrase 3 topics as questions/hypotheses
- [X] Talk about 3 main take-home points at the beginning as well as
  the end
- [X] On summary slides, bullets on left, image on right for each
  bullet
- [X] Time was around 40 minutes, so add at least 5 minutes of content
- [ ] Keep reserve slides at the end with cut figures in case they
  come in handy for answering audience questions

* DONE Notes from Sabah

- [X] Slide 1: Is the title final? If not, would adjust to (also note
  space in title slide for bioinformaticsanalysis) "Bioinformatic
  analysis of genomic and epigenomic data in the context of CD4+T-cell
  differentiation and diagnosis and treatment of transplant rejection"
- [X] Slide with organ bar chart: Adjust title to 'Organ donation
  statistics for the USA in 2018', remove from bottom and make image
  itself bigger
- [X] What's the connection between organ transplant, graft rejection,
  and immune response? Make that clear in the transition between
  slides. We now want to know about graft rejection because.... why?
  what about what we just learned with the organ transplants directly
  connects?
- [X] Condense these bullet points. The previous set of bullet points
  is a perfect example of spacing and length readable in a short
  amount of time for the audience
- [X] More time on allografting and less time on graft rejection. What
  is it? How does it work? Provide a brief example/image right before
  the chart
- [X] Rejection and immmuno suppressive drugs -- this is a great
  transition (well explained) but again the bullet points need to be
  condensed. Bring in an image with these as well to give the audience
  'a visual break' before you intro your topics
- [X] I like the update to thesis topics. I would adjust such that 'my
  thesis topics' is replaced with the overarching question you want to
  answer for these 3 topics and make that the heading.
- [X] Then, introduce the 3 topics in the next slide (blue font of
  topic 1, 2... etc)
- [X] Then, introduce the additional text for each topic in the next
  slide
- [X] You have the 'memory cells' slides repeated 4x, and I see that
  you're highlighting different sections each time. Pair the heading
  to match with this (what you want to say in each as the take-home) >
  having the same heading repeated
