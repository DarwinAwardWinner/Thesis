* Notes from lab meeting practice run

** DONE Mechanical issues
- [X] Blurry slide changes
  - Solution: use Acrobat for presenting
- [X] Use widescreen aspect ratio -- option to show 2 figures side by
  side
- [X] Header is hard to read/easy to ignore because of color scheme.
  Consider dark text on white bg instead.
- [X] No figure numbers
- [X] No chapter numbers, just "3 parts"
- [X] Way to display speaker notes alongside slides? Maybe import into
  PPT?

** TODO Presentation issues
- [ ] Bigger axis labels
- [ ] Better cluster ordering, labeling, and transpose violin plots
  for consistency
- [ ] Whenever possible: micro first to introduce the plot, then macro
  to show the full plot
- [ ] For PCoA plots, show just one donor at a time first to show
  the trend in a simpler context

** TODO Content issues
- [ ] Maybe show more preprocessing, batch correction, etc.
- [ ] Tie conclusions back to intro, add future directions
- [ ] Don't say "too complicated to explain"
- [ ] Intro slide for MOFA: how and why
- [ ] Too many bullet points. Don't need to write everything I say.
  Move to speaker notes.
- [ ] Intro the histone marks and why we picked them
- [ ] Brief 30 second intro to RNA-seq & ChIP-seq
- [ ] Rephrase 3 topics as questions/hypotheses
- [ ] Talk about 3 main take-home points at the beginning as well as
  the end
- [ ] Keep reserve slides at the end with cut figures in case they
  come in handy for answering audience questions
- [ ] On summary slides, bullets on left, image on right for each
  bullet
- [ ] Time was around 40 minutes, so add at least 5 minutes of content
