## Organ transplants are a life-saving treatment

::: incremental

* 36,528 transplants performed in the USA in 2018[^organdonor]

* 100 transplants every day!

* Over 113,000 people on the national transplant waiting list as of
  July 2019

## Types of grafts

A graft is categorized based on the relationship between donor and recipient:

. . .

::: incremental

* **Autograft:** Donor and recipient are the *same individual*

* **Allograft:** Donor and recipient are *different individuals* of
  the *same species*

* **Xenograft:** Donor and recipient are *different species*

## Recipient T-cells reject allogenic MHCs

## Rejection is treated with immune suppressive drugs

<!-- TODO: Need a graphic, or maybe a table of common drugs +
mechanisms, or a diagram for periodic checking. -->

::: incremental

* Graft recipient must take immune suppressive drugs indefinitely

* Graft is monitored for rejection and dosage adjusted over time

* Immune suppression is a delicate balance: too much and too little
  are both problematic.

Genome-wide epigenetic analysis of H3K4 and H3K27 methylation in naïve
and memory $\mathsf{CD4}^{+}$ T-cell activation

## Memory cells: faster, stronger, and more independent

## Memory cells: faster, stronger, and more independent

![Memory T-cells respond more strongly to activation](graphics/presentation/T-cells-D-SVG.png)

::: notes

Compared to naïve cells, memory cells:

* respond to a lower antigen concentration
* respond more strongly at any given antigen concentration
* require less co-stimulation
* are somewhat independent of some types of co-stimulation required by
  naïve cells
* evolve over time to respond even more strongly to their antigen

:::

## Memory cells are a problem for immune suppression

\large

Result:

\normalsize

* Memory cells require progressively higher doses of immune suppresive
  drugs
* Dosage cannot be increased indefinitely without compromising the
  immune system's ability to fight infection

## We need a better understanding of immune memory

* Cell surface markers of naïve and memory $\mathsf{CD4}^{+}$ T-cells
  are fairly well-characterized
* But internal mechanisms that allow memory cells to respond
  differently to the same stimulus (antigen presentation) are not
  well-understood
  
. . .

* A reasonable hypothesis is that some of these mechanisms are
  epigenetic: using histone marks or DNA methylation to regulate the
  expression of certain genes
* We can test this hypothesis by measuring gene expression (using
  RNA-seq) and histone methylation (using ChIP-seq) in naïve and
  memory T-cells before and after activation
  
## Experimental design

* Separately isolate naïve and memory $\mathsf{CD4}^{+}$ T-cells from
  4 donors
* Activate with CD3/CD28 beads
* Take samples at 4 time points: Day 0 (pre-activation), Day 1 (early
  activation), Day 5 (peak activation), and Day 14 (post-activation)
* Do RNA-seq + ChIP-seq for 3 histone marks (H3K4me2, H3K4me3, &
  H3K27me3) for each sample.

## The story so far

<!-- TODO: Left column: text; right column: flip through relevant image -->

* H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 occur on many consecutive histones in
  broad regions across the genome
* These enriched regions occur more commonly within a certain radius
  of gene promoters
* This "effective promoter radius" is consistent across all samples
  for a given histone mark, but differs between histone marks
* Presence or absence of a peak within this radius is correlated with
  gene expression
  
. . .

Next: Does the position of a histone modification within a gene
promoter matter to that gene's expression, or is it merely the
presence or absence anywhere within the promoter?

## What have we learned?

### H3K4me2 & H3K4me3

* Peak closer to promoter $\Rightarrow$ more likely gene is highly
  expressed
* Slightly asymmetric in favor of peaks downstream of TSS

. . .

### H3K27me3

* Depletion of H3K27me3 at TSS associated with elevated gene
  expression
* Enrichment of H3K27me3 upstream of TSS even more strongly associated
  with elevated expression
* Other coverage profiles not associated with elevated expression

![(Insert figure legend)](graphics/CD4-csaw/MOFA-LF-scatter-small.png)

## What have we learned?

* Almost no differential modification observed between naïve and
  memory at Day 14, despite plenty of differential modification at
  earlier time points.
* RNA-seq data and all 3 histone marks' ChIP-seq data all show
  "convergence" between naïve and memory by Day 14 in the first 2 or 3
  principal coordinates.
* MOFA captures this convergence pattern in one of the latent factors,
  indicating that this is a shared pattern across all 4 data sets.

## Takeaway 1: Each histone mark has an "effective promoter radius"

* H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq reads are enriched in broad
  regions across the genome, representing areas where the histone
  modification is present
* These enriched regions occur more commonly within a certain radius
  of gene promoters
* This "effective promoter radius" is specific to each histone mark
* Presence or absence of a peak within this radius is correlated with
  gene expression
  
## Takeaway 2: Peak position within the promoter is important

* H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 peaks are more strongly associated with elevated
  gene expression the closer they are to the TSS, with a slight bias
  toward downstream peaks.
* H3K27me3 depletion at the TSS and enrichement upstream are both
  associated with elevated expression, while other patterns are not.
* In all histone marks, position of modification within promoter
  appears to be an important factor in association with gene
  expression

## Takeaway 3: Expression & epigenetic state both converge at Day 14

* At Day 14, almost no differential modification observed between
  naïve and memory cells
* Naïve and memory converge visually in PCoA plots
* Convergence is a shared pattern of variation across all 3 histone
  marks and gene expression
* This is consistent with the hypothesis that the naïve cells have
  differentiated into a more memory-like phenotype by day 14.
