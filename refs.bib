abstract = {MOTIVATION: In searching for differentially expressed (DE) genes in microarray data, we often observe a fraction of the genes to have unequal variability between groups. This is not an issue in large samples, where a valid test exists that uses individual variances separately. The problem arises in the small-sample setting, where the approximately valid Welch test lacks sensitivity, while the more sensitive moderated t-test assumes equal variance.

METHODS: We introduce a moderated Welch test (MWT) that allows unequal variance between groups. It is based on (i) weighting of pooled and unpooled standard errors and (ii) improved estimation of the gene-level variance that exploits the information from across the genes.

RESULTS: When a non-trivial proportion of genes has unequal variability, false discovery rate (FDR) estimates based on the standard t and moderated t-tests are often too optimistic, while the standard Welch test has low sensitivity. The MWT is shown to (i) perform better than the standard t, the standard Welch and the moderated t-tests when the variances are unequal between groups and (ii) perform similarly to the moderated t, and better than the standard t and Welch tests when the group variances are equal. These results mean that MWT is more reliable than other existing tests over wider range of data conditions.

AVAILABILITY: R package to perform MWT is available at http://www.meb.ki.se/{\~{}}yudpaw},

abstract = {Flap endonuclease (FEN1), essential for DNA replication and repair, removes RNA and DNA 5' flaps. FEN1 5' nuclease superfamily members acting in nucleotide excision repair (XPG), mismatch repair (EXO1), and homologous recombination (GEN1) paradoxically incise structurally distinct bubbles, ends, or Holliday junctions, respectively. Here, structural and functional analyses of human FEN1:DNA complexes show structure-specific, sequence-independent recognition for nicked dsDNA bent 100° with unpaired 3' and 5' flaps. Above the active site, a helical cap over a gateway formed by two helices enforces ssDNA threading and specificity for free 5' ends. Crystallographic analyses of product and substrate complexes reveal that dsDNA binding and bending, the ssDNA gateway, and double-base unpairing flanking the scissile phosphate control precise flap incision by the two-metal-ion active site. Superfamily conserved motifs bind and open dsDNA; direct the target region into the helical gateway, permitting only nonbase-paired oligonucleotides active site access; and support a unified understanding of superfamily substrate specificity.},

abstract = {Microarray gene expression signatures hold great promise to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease. However, current documentation standards of such signatures do not allow for an unambiguous application to study-external patients. This hinders independent evaluation, effectively delaying the use of signatures in clinical practice. Data from eight publicly available clinical microarray studies were analyzed and the consistency of study-internal with study-external diagnoses was evaluated. Study-external classifications were based on documented information only. Documenting a signature is conceptually different from reporting a list of genes. We show that even the exact quantitative specification of a classification rule alone does not define a signature unambiguously. We found that discrepancy between study-internal and study-external diagnoses can be as frequent as 30{\%} (worst case) and 18{\%} (median). By using the proposed documentation by value strategy, which documents quantitative preprocessing information, the median discrepancy was reduced to 1{\%}. The process of evaluating microarray gene expression diagnostic signatures and bringing them to clinical practice can be substantially improved and made more reliable by better documentation of the signatures.},

abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( {\textgreater} 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

abstract = {The overall fidelity of protein synthesis has been thought to rely on the combined accuracy of two basic processes: the aminoacylation of transfer RNAs with their cognate amino acid by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and the selection of cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs by the ribosome in cooperation with the GTPase elongation factor EF-Tu. These two processes, which together ensure the specific acceptance of a correctly charged cognate tRNA into the aminoacyl (A) site, operate before peptide bond formation. Here we report the identification of an additional mechanism that contributes to high fidelity protein synthesis after peptidyl transfer, using a well-defined in vitro bacterial translation system. In this retrospective quality control step, the incorporation of an amino acid from a non-cognate tRNA into the growing polypeptide chain leads to a general loss of specificity in the A site of the ribosome, and thus to a propagation of errors that results in abortive termination of protein synthesis.},

abstract = {A central challenge of biology is to map and understand gene regulation on a genome-wide scale. For any given genome, only a small fraction of the regulatory elements embedded in the DNA sequence have been characterized, and there is great interest in developing computational methods to systematically map all these elements and understand their relationships. Such computational efforts, however, are significantly hindered by the overwhelming size of non-coding regions and the statistical variability and complex spatial organizations of regulatory elements and interactions. Genome-wide catalogs of regulatory elements for all model species simply do not yet exist. The MotifMap system uses databases of transcription factor binding motifs, refined genome alignments, and a comparative genomic statistical approach to provide comprehensive maps of candidate regulatory elements encoded in the genomes of model species. The system is used to derive new genome-wide maps for yeast, fly, worm, mouse, and human. The human map contains 519,108 sites for 570 matrices with a False Discovery Rate of 0.1 or less. The new maps are assessed in several ways, for instance using high-throughput experimental ChIP-seq data and AUC statistics, providing strong evidence for their accuracy and coverage. The maps can be usefully integrated with many other kinds of omic data and are available at $\backslash$n                    http://motifmap.igb.uci.edu/$\backslash$n                    $\backslash$n                  . MotifMap and its integration with other data provide a foundation for analyzing gene regulation on a genome-wide scale, and for automatically generating regulatory pathways and hypotheses. The power of this approach is demonstrated and discussed using the P53 apoptotic pathway and the Gli hedgehog pathways as examples.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Histone modifications are a key epigenetic mechanism to activate or repress the transcription of genes. Datasets of matched transcription data and histone modification data obtained by ChIP-seq exist, but methods for integrative analysis of both data types are still rare. Here, we present a novel bioinformatics approach to detect genes that show different transcript abundances between two conditions putatively caused by alterations in histone modification. RESULTS: We introduce a correlation measure for integrative analysis of ChIP-seq and gene transcription data measured by RNA sequencing or microarrays and demonstrate that a proper normalization of ChIP-seq data is crucial. We suggest applying Bayesian mixture models of different types of distributions to further study the distribution of the correlation measure. The implicit classification of the mixture models is used to detect genes with differences between two conditions in both gene transcription and histone modification. The method is applied to different datasets, and its superiority to a naive separate analysis of both data types is demonstrated.Availability and implementation: R/Bioconductor package epigenomix.

abstract = {Transcriptome-based biosensors are expected to have a large impact on the future of biotechnology. However, a central aspect of transcriptomics is differential expression analysis, where, currently, deep RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has the potential to replace the microarray as the standard assay for RNA quantification. Our contributions here to RNA-seq differential expression analysis are two-fold. First, given the high cost of an RNA-seq run, biological replicates are rare, and therefore, information sharing across genes to obtain variance estimates is crucial.  To handle such information sharing in a rigorous manner, we propose an hierarchical, empirical Bayes approach (R-EBSeq) that combines the Cufflinks model for generating relative transcript abundance measurements, known as FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript length per million mapped reads) with the EBArrays framework, which was previously developed for empirical Bayes analysis of microarray data. A desirable feature of R-EBSeq is easy-to-implement analysis of more than pairwise comparisons, as we illustrate with experimental data. Secondly, we develop the standard RNA-seq test data set, on the level of reads, where 79 transcripts are artificially differentially expressed and, therefore, explicitly known. This test data set allows us to compare the performance, in terms of the true discovery rate, of R-EBSeq to three other widely used RNAseq data analysis packages: Cuffdiff, DEseq and BaySeq. Our analysis indicates that DESeq identifies the first half of the differentially expressed transcripts well, but then is outperformed by Cuffdiff and R-EBSeq. Cuffdiff and R-EBSeq are the two top performers. Thus, R-EBSeq offers good performance, while allowing flexible and rigorous comparison of multiple biological conditions.},

While many methods exist to interrogate methylation states, few current methods offer large-scale, targeted, single CpG resolution. We report an approach combining bisulfite treatment followed by microdroplet PCR with next-generation sequencing to assay the methylation state of 50 genes in the regions 1 kb upstream of and downstream from their transcription start sites. This method yielded 96{\%} coverage of the targeted CpGs and demonstrated high correlation between CpG island (CGI) DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation. The method was scaled to interrogate the methylation status of 77,674 CpGs in the promoter regions of 2100 genes in primary CD4 T cells. The 2100 gene library yielded 97{\%} coverage of all targeted CpGs and 99{\%} of the target amplicons.},

@article{Chung2014,
abstract = {The Aspergillus fumigatus sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) SrbA belongs to the basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors and is crucial for antifungal drug resistance and virulence. The latter phenotype is especially striking, as loss of SrbA results in complete loss of virulence in murine models of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). How fungal SREBPs mediate fungal virulence is unknown, though it has been suggested that lack of growth in hypoxic conditions accounts for the attenuated virulence. To further understand the role of SrbA in fungal infection site pathobiology, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used to identify genes under direct SrbA transcriptional regulation in hypoxia. These results confirmed the direct regulation of ergosterol biosynthesis and iron uptake by SrbA in hypoxia and revealed new roles for SrbA in nitrate assimilation and heme biosynthesis. Moreover, functional characterization of an SrbA target gene with sequence similarity to SrbA identified a new transcriptional regulator of the fungal hypoxia response and virulence, SrbB. SrbB co-regulates genes involved in heme biosynthesis and demethylation of C4-sterols with SrbA in hypoxic conditions. However, SrbB also has regulatory functions independent of SrbA including regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. Loss of SrbB markedly attenuates A. fumigatus virulence, and loss of both SREBPs further reduces in vivo fungal growth. These data suggest that both A. fumigatus SREBPs are critical for hypoxia adaptation and virulence and reveal new insights into SREBPs' complex role in infection site adaptation and fungal virulence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing, such as ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses, enables various features of organisms to be compared through tag counts. Recent studies have demonstrated that the normalization step for RNA-seq data is critical for a more accurate subsequent analysis of differential gene expression. Development of a more robust normalization method is desirable for identifying the true difference in tag count data.

RESULTS: We describe a strategy for normalizing tag count data, focusing on RNA-seq. The key concept is to remove data assigned as potential differentially expressed genes (DEGs) before calculating the normalization factor. Several R packages for identifying DEGs are currently available, and each package uses its own normalization method and gene ranking algorithm. We compared a total of eight package combinations: four R packages (edgeR, DESeq, baySeq, and NBPSeq) with their default normalization settings and with our normalization strategy. Many synthetic datasets under various scenarios were evaluated on the basis of the area under the curve (AUC) as a measure for both sensitivity and specificity. We found that packages using our strategy in the data normalization step overall performed well. This result was also observed for a real experimental dataset.

CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the elimination of potential DEGs is essential for more accurate normalization of RNA-seq data. The concept of this normalization strategy can widely be applied to other types of tag count data and to microarray data.},

While transcript isoform diversity contributes to shape cellular specificity, it is currently unclear what is the balance of contributions from alternative splicing compared to alternative start and termination sites of transcription. Here, we address this question by analyzing data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project. We found tissue-dependent usage of exons for around one-half of expressed genes. Although tissue-dependent splicing was frequent among untranslated exons, it explained less than half of the differences in exon usage across tissues, suggesting that most of these differences were driven by alternative transcription start and termination sites. Analysis of the FANTOM Project data confirmed widespread tissue-dependent usage of alternative transcriptional start sites. Our analysis highlights alternative initiation and termination sites of transcription as the main drivers of isoform diversity across tissues. We also show that most tissue-dependent splicing is unlikely to have consequences at the proteome level.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The accurate detection of orthologous segments (also referred to as syntenic segments) plays a key role in comparative genomics, as it is useful for inferring genome rearrangement scenarios and computing whole-genome alignments. Although a number of algorithms for detecting orthologous segments have been proposed, none of them contain a framework for optimizing their parameter values. METHODS: In the present study, we propose an algorithm, named OSfinder (Orthologous Segment finder), which uses a novel scoring scheme based on stochastic models. OSfinder takes as input the positions of short homologous regions (also referred to as anchors) and explicitly discriminates orthologous anchors from non-orthologous anchors by using Markov chain models which represent respective geometric distributions of lengths of orthologous and non-orthologous anchors. Such stochastic modeling makes it possible to optimize parameter values by maximizing the likelihood of the input dataset, and to automate the setting of the optimal parameter values. RESULTS: We validated the accuracies of orthology-mapping algorithms on the basis of their consistency with the orthology annotation of genes. Our evaluation tests using mammalian and bacterial genomes demonstrated that OSfinder shows higher accuracy than previous algorithms. AVAILABILITY: The OSfinder software was implemented as a C++ program. The software is freely available at http://osfinder.dna.bio.keio.ac.jp under the GNU General Public License.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: RNA-Seq is a promising new technology for accurately measuring gene expression levels. Expression estimation with RNA-Seq requires the mapping of relatively short sequencing reads to a reference genome or transcript set. Because reads are generally shorter than transcripts from which they are derived, a single read may map to multiple genes and isoforms, complicating expression analyses. Previous computational methods either discard reads that map to multiple locations or allocate them to genes heuristically. RESULTS: We present a generative statistical model and associated inference methods that handle read mapping uncertainty in a principled manner. Through simulations parameterized by real RNA-Seq data, we show that our method is more accurate than previous methods. Our improved accuracy is the result of handling read mapping uncertainty with a statistical model and the estimation of gene expression levels as the sum of isoform expression levels. Unlike previous methods, our method is capable of modeling non-uniform read distributions. Simulations with our method indicate that a read length of 20-25 bases is optimal for gene-level expression estimation from mouse and maize RNA-Seq data when sequencing throughput is fixed.},

This concern has rendered the use of low quality RNA samples in whole-genome expression profiling problematic. Yet, low quality samples (for example, samples collected in the course of fieldwork) are at times the sole means of addressing specific questions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We sought to quantify the impact of variation in RNA quality on estimates of gene expression levels based on RNA-seq data. To do so, we collected expression data from tissue samples that were allowed to decay for varying amounts of time prior to RNA extraction. The RNA samples we collected spanned the entire range of RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values (a metric commonly used to assess RNA quality). We observed widespread effects of RNA quality on measurements of gene expression levels, as well as a slight but significant loss of library complexity in more degraded samples.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: While standard normalizations failed to account for the effects of degradation, we found that by explicitly controlling for the effects of RIN using a linear model framework we can correct for the majority of these effects. We conclude that in instances in which RIN and the effect of interest are not associated, this approach can help recover biologically meaningful signals in data from degraded RNA samples.},

abstract = {In biospectroscopy, suitably annotated and statistically independent samples (e.g. patients, batches, etc.) for classifier training and testing are scarce and costly. Learning curves show the model performance as function of the training sample size and can help to determine the sample size needed to train good classifiers. However, building a good model is actually not enough: the performance must also be proven. We discuss learning curves for typical small sample size situations with 5-25 independent samples per class. Although the classification models achieve acceptable performance, the learning curve can be completely masked by the random testing uncertainty due to the equally limited test sample size. In consequence, we determine test sample sizes necessary to achieve reasonable precision in the validation and find that 75-100 samples will usually be needed to test a good but not perfect classifier. Such a data set will then allow refined sample size planning on the basis of the achieved performance. We also demonstrate how to calculate necessary sample sizes in order to show the superiority of one classifier over another: this often requires hundreds of statistically independent test samples or is even theoretically impossible. We demonstrate our findings with a data set of ca. 2550 Raman spectra of single cells (five classes: erythrocytes, leukocytes and three tumour cell lines BT-20, MCF-7 and OCI-AML3) as well as by an extensive simulation that allows precise determination of the actual performance of the models in question.},

abstract = {Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing (RNA-seq) has been readily embraced by geneticists and molecular ecologists alike. As with all high-throughput technologies, it is critical to understand which analytic strategies are best suited and which parameters may bias the interpretation of the data. Here we use a comprehensive simulation approach to explore how various features of the transcriptome (complexity, degree of polymorphism $\pi$, alternative splicing), technological processing (sequencing error $\epsilon$, library normalization) and bioinformatic workflow (de novo vs. mapping assembly, reference genome quality) impact transcriptome quality and inference of differential gene expression (DE). We find that transcriptome assembly and gene expression profiling (EdgeR vs. BaySeq software) works well even in the absence of a reference genome and is robust across a broad range of parameters. We advise against library normalization and in most situations advocate mapping assemblies to an annotated genome of a divergent sister clade, which generally outperformed de novo assembly (Trans-Abyss, Trinity, Soapdenovo-Trans). Transcriptome complexity (size, paralogs, alternative splicing isoforms) negatively affected the assembly and DE profiling, whereas the effects of sequencing error and polymorphism were almost negligible. Finally, we highlight the challenge of gene name assignment for de novo assemblies, the importance of mapping strategies and raise awareness of challenges associated with the quality of reference genomes. Overall, our results have significant practical and methodological implications and can provide guidance in the design and analysis of RNA-seq experiments, particularly for organisms where genomic background information is lacking.},

abstract = {Ultra-deep RNA sequencing has become a powerful approach for genome-wide analysis of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. We develop MATS (multivariate analysis of transcript splicing), a bayesian statistical framework for flexible hypothesis testing of differential alternative splicing patterns on RNA-Seq data. MATS uses a multivariate uniform prior to model the between-sample correlation in exon splicing patterns, and a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method coupled with a simulation-based adaptive sampling procedure to calculate the P-value and false discovery rate (FDR) of differential alternative splicing. Importantly, the MATS approach is applicable to almost any type of null hypotheses of interest, providing the flexibility to identify differential alternative splicing events that match a given user-defined pattern. We evaluated the performance of MATS using simulated and real RNA-Seq data sets. In the RNA-Seq analysis of alternative splicing events regulated by the epithelial-specific splicing factor ESRP1, we obtained a high RT-PCR validation rate of 86{\%} for differential exon skipping events with a MATS FDR of {\textless}10{\%}. Additionally, over the full list of RT-PCR tested exons, the MATS FDR estimates matched well with the experimental validation rate. Our results demonstrate that MATS is an effective and flexible approach for detecting differential alternative splicing from RNA-Seq data.},

abstract = {During colon cancer, epigenetic alterations contribute to the dysregulation of major cellular functions and signaling pathways. Modifications in chromatin signatures such as H3K4me3 and H3K9ac, which are associated with transcriptionally active genes, can lead to genomic instability and perturb the expression of gene sets associated with oncogenic processes. In order to further elucidate early pre-tumorigenic epigenetic molecular events driving CRC, we integrated diverse, genome-wide, epigenetic inputs (by high throughput sequencing of RNA, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac) and compared differentially expressed transcripts (DE) and enriched regions (DER) in an in-vivo rat colon cancer progression model. Carcinogen (AOM) effects were detected genome-wide at the RNA (116 DE genes), K9ac (49 DERs including 24 genes) and K4me3 (7678 DERs including 3792 genes) level. RNA-seq differential expression and pathway analysis indicated that interferon-associated innate immune responses were impacted by AOM exposure. Despite extensive associations between K4me3 DERs and colon tumorigenesis (1210 genes were linked to colorectal carcinoma) including FOXO3, GNAI2, H2AFX, MSH2, NR3C1, PDCD4 and VEGFA, these changes were not reflected at the RNA gene expression level during early cancer progression. Collectively, our results indicate that carcinogen-induced changes in gene K4me3 DERs are harbingers of future transcriptional events, which drive malignant transformation of the colon.},

@article{Figueroa2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Supervised learning methods need annotated data in order to generate efficient models. Annotated data, however, is a relatively scarce resource and can be expensive to obtain. For both passive and active learning methods, there is a need to estimate the size of the annotated sample required to reach a performance target.

METHODS: We designed and implemented a method that fits an inverse power law model to points of a given learning curve created using a small annotated training set. Fitting is carried out using nonlinear weighted least squares optimization. The fitted model is then used to predict the classifier's performance and confidence interval for larger sample sizes. For evaluation, the nonlinear weighted curve fitting method was applied to a set of learning curves generated using clinical text and waveform classification tasks with active and passive sampling methods, and predictions were validated using standard goodness of fit measures. As control we used an un-weighted fitting method.

RESULTS: A total of 568 models were fitted and the model predictions were compared with the observed performances. Depending on the data set and sampling method, it took between 80 to 560 annotated samples to achieve mean average and root mean squared error below 0.01. Results also show that our weighted fitting method outperformed the baseline un-weighted method (p {\textless} 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: This paper describes a simple and effective sample size prediction algorithm that conducts weighted fitting of learning curves. The algorithm outperformed an un-weighted algorithm described in previous literature. It can help researchers determine annotation sample size for supervised machine learning.},

Improvements in genome assembly and the wide availability of mRNA-seq data are also creating opportunities to update and re-annotate previously published genome annotations.

Here we describe a genome-wide effort, carried out as part of the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) project, to identify human genes not yet in the gene catalogs. Our approach was to produce gene predictions by algorithms that rely on comparative sequence data but do not require direct cDNA evidence, then to test predicted novel genes by RT-PCR. We have identified 734 novel gene fragments (NGFs) containing 2188 exons with, at most, weak prior cDNA support. These NGFs correspond to an estimated 563 distinct genes, of which {\textgreater}160 are completely absent from the major gene catalogs, while hundreds of others represent significant extensions of known genes. The NGFs appear to be predominantly protein-coding genes rather than noncoding RNAs, unlike novel transcribed sequences identified by technologies such as tiling arrays and CAGE. They tend to be expressed at low levels and in a tissue-specific manner, and they are enriched for roles in motor activity, cell adhesion, connective tissue, and central nervous system development. Our results demonstrate that many important genes and gene fragments have been missed by traditional approaches to gene discovery but can be identified by their evolutionary signatures using comparative sequence data. However, they suggest that hundreds-not thousands-of protein-coding genes are completely missing from the current gene catalogs.},

In the ubiquitous negative binomial model for RNA-seq data, each gene is given a dispersion parameter, and correctly estimating these dispersion parameters is vital to detecting differential expression. Since the dispersions control the variances of the gene counts, underestimation may lead to false discovery, while overestimation may lower the rate of true detection. After briefly reviewing several popular dispersion estimation methods, this article describes a simulation study that compares them in terms of point estimation and the effect on the performance of tests for differential expression. The methods that maximize the test performance are the ones that use a moderate degree of dispersion shrinkage: the DSS, Tagwise wqCML, and Tagwise APL. In practical RNA-seq data analysis, we recommend using one of these moderate-shrinkage methods with the QLShrink test in QuasiSeq R package.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: RNA-seq technology has been widely adopted as an attractive alternative to microarray-based methods to study global gene expression. However, robust statistical tools to analyze these complex datasets are still lacking. By grouping genes with similar expression profiles across treatments, cluster analysis provides insight into gene functions and networks and hence is an important technique for RNA-seq data analysis.

RESULTS: In this manuscript, we derive clustering algorithms based on appropriate probability models for RNA-seq data. An Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and another two stochastic versions of EM algorithms are described. In addition, a strategy for initialization based on likelihood is proposed to improve the clustering algorithms. Moreover, we present a model-based hybrid-hierarchical clustering method to generate a tree structure that allows visualization of relationships among clusters as well as flexibility of choosing the number of clusters. Results from both simulation studies and analysis of a maize RNA-seq dataset show that our proposed methods provide better clustering results than alternative methods such as the K-means algorithm and hierarchical clustering methods that are not based on probability models.

AVAILABILITY: An R package, MBCluster.Seq, has been developed to implement our proposed algorithms. This R package provides fast computation and is publicly available at http://www.r-project.org.

abstract = {Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were found to be dysregulated in a variety of tumors. However, it remains unknown how and through what molecular mechanisms the expression of lncRNAs is controlled. In this study, we found that the lncRNA Low Expression in Tumor (lncRNA-LET) was generally downregulated in hepatocellular carcinomas, colorectal cancers, and squamous-cell lung carcinomas. We demonstrated that hypoxia-induced histone deacetylase 3 repressed lncRNA-LET by reducing the histone acetylation-mediated modulation of the lncRNA-LET promoter region. Interestingly, the downregulation of lncRNA-LET was found to be a key step in the stabilization of nuclear factor 90 protein, which leads to hypoxia-induced cancer cell invasion. Moreover, the relationship among hypoxia, histone acetylation disorder, low lncRNA-LET expression level, and metastasis was found in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma samples. These results advance our understanding of the role of lncRNA-LET as a regulator of hypoxia signaling and offer new avenues for therapeutic intervention against cancer progression. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Identifying transcription factors (TF) involved in producing a genome-wide transcriptional profile is an essential step in building mechanistic model that can explain observed gene expression data. We developed a statistical framework for constructing genome-wide signatures of TF activity, and for using such signatures in the analysis of gene expression data produced by complex transcriptional regulatory programs. Our framework integrates ChIP-seq data and appropriately matched gene expression profiles to identify True REGulatory (TREG) TF-gene interactions. It provides genome-wide quantification of the likelihood of regulatory TF-gene interaction that can be used to either identify regulated genes, or as genome-wide signature of TF activity. To effectively use ChIP-seq data, we introduce a novel statistical model that integrates information from all binding “peaks” within 2 Mb window around a gene's transcription start site (TSS), and provides gene-level binding scores and probabilities of regulatory interaction. In the second step we integrate these binding scores and regulatory probabilities with gene expression data to assess the likelihood of True REGulatory (TREG) TF-gene interactions. We demonstrate the advantages of TREG framework in identifying genes regulated by two TFs with widely different distribution of functional binding events (ER$\alpha$ and E2f1). We also show that TREG signatures of TF activity vastly improve our ability to detect involvement of ER$\alpha$ in producing complex diseases-related transcriptional profiles. Through a large study of disease-related transcriptional signatures and transcriptional signatures of drug activity, we demonstrate that increase in statistical power associated with the use of TREG signatures makes the crucial difference in identifying key targets for treatment, and drugs to use for treatment. All methods are implemented in an open-source R package treg. The package also contains all data used in the analysis including 494 TREG binding profiles based on ENCODE ChIP-seq data. The treg package can be downloaded at http://GenomicsPortals.org.},

abstract = {Standard Illumina mate-paired libraries are constructed from 3- to 5-kb DNA fragments by a blunt-end circularization. Sequencing reads that pass through the junction of the two joined ends of a 3-5-kb DNA fragment are not easy to identify and pose problems during mapping and de novo assembly. Longer read lengths increase the possibility that a read will cross the junction. To solve this problem, we developed a mate-paired protocol for use with Illumina sequencing technology that uses Cre-Lox recombination instead of blunt end circularization. In this method, a LoxP sequence is incorporated at the junction site. This sequence allows screening reads for junctions without using a reference genome. Junction reads can be trimmed or split at the junction. Moreover, the location of the LoxP sequence in the reads distinguishes mate-paired reads from spurious paired-end reads. We tested this new method by preparing and sequencing a mate-paired library with an insert size of 3 kb from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We present an analysis of the library quality statistics and a new bio-informatics tool called DeLoxer that can be used to analyze an IlluminaCre-Lox mate-paired data set. We also demonstrate how the resulting data significantly improves a de novo assembly of the S. cerevisiae genome.},

abstract = {Motivation: There is a growing number of studies generating matched Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 and gene expression data, yet there is a corresponding shortage of statistical tools aimed at their integrative analysis. Such integrative tools are important for the discovery of epigenetically regulated gene modules or molecular pathways, which play key roles in cellular differentiation and disease.Results: Here, we present a novel functional supervised algorithm, called Functional Epigenetic Modules (FEM), for the integrative analysis of Infinium 450k DNA methylation and matched or unmatched gene expression data. The algorithm identifies gene modules of coordinated differential methylation and differential expression in the context of a human interactome. We validate the FEM algorithm on simulated and real data, demonstrating how it successfully retrieves an epigenetically deregulated gene, previously known to drive endometrial cancer development. Importantly, in the same cancer, FEM identified a novel epigenetically deregulated hotspot, directly upstream of the well-known progesterone receptor tumour suppressor pathway. In the context of cellular differentiation, FEM successfully identifies known endothelial cell subtype-specific gene expression markers, as well as a novel gene module whose overexpression in blood endothelial cells is mediated by DNA hypomethylation. The systems-level integrative framework presented here could be used to identify novel key genes or signalling pathways, which drive cellular differentiation or disease through an underlying epigenetic mechanism.Availability and implementation: FEM is freely available as an R-package from http://sourceforge.net/projects/funepimod.Contact: andrew@picb.ac.cnSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Classification in bioinformatics often suffers from small samples in conjunction with large numbers of features, which makes error estimation problematic. When a sample is small, there is insufficient data to split the sample and the same data are used for both classifier design and error estimation. Error estimation can suffer from high variance, bias, or both. The problem of choosing a suitable error estimator is exacerbated by the fact that estimation performance depends on the rule used to design the classifier, the feature-label distribution to which the classifier is to be applied, and the sam- ple size. This paper reviews the performance of training-sample error estimators with respect to several criteria: estimation accuracy, variance, bias, correlation with the true error, regression on the true error, and accuracy in ranking feature sets. A number of error estimators are considered: resubstitution, leave-one-out cross-validation, 10-fold cross-validation, bol- stered resubstitution, semi-bolstered resubstitution, .632 bootstrap, .632+ bootstrap, and optimal bootstrap. It illustrates these performance criteria for certain models and for two real data sets, referring to the literature for more extensive appli- cations of these criteria. The results given in the present paper are consistent with those in the literature and lead to two conclusions: (1) much greater effort needs to be focused on error estimation, and (2) owing to the generally poor perform- ance of error estimators on small samples, for a conclusion based on a small-sample error estimator to be considered valid, it should be supported by evidence that the estimator in question can be expected to perform sufficiently well under the circumstances to justify the conclusion.},

Direct comparison and alignment of existing cDNA sequences from a related species is an effective and readily available means to determine genes in the new genomes. Current spliced alignment programs are inadequate for comparing sequences between different species, owing to their low sensitivity and splice junction accuracy. A new spliced alignment tool, sim4cc, overcomes problems in the earlier tools by incorporating three new features: universal spaced seeds, to increase sensitivity and allow comparisons between species at various evolutionary distances, and powerful splice signal models and evolutionarily-aware alignment techniques, to improve the accuracy of gene models. When tested on vertebrate comparisons at diverse evolutionary distances, sim4cc had significantly higher sensitivity compared to existing alignment programs, more than 10{\%} higher than the closest competitor for some comparisons, while being comparable in speed to its predecessor, sim4. Sim4cc can be used in one-to-one or one-to-many comparisons of genomic and cDNA sequences, and can also be effectively incorporated into a high-throughput annotation engine, as demonstrated by the mapping of 64,000 Fagus grandifolia 454 ESTs and unigenes to the poplar genome.},

abstract = {A popular approach for comparing gene expression levels between (replicated) conditions of RNA sequencing data relies on counting reads that map to features of interest. Within such count-based methods, many flexible and advanced statistical approaches now exist and offer the ability to adjust for covariates (e.g., batch effects). Often, these methods include some sort of (sharing of information) across features to improve inferences in small samples. It is important to achieve an appropriate tradeoff between statistical power and protection against outliers. Here, we study the robustness of existing approaches for count-based differential expression analysis and propose a new strategy based on observation weights that can be used within existing frameworks. The results suggest that outliers can have a global effect on differential analyses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approach with real data and simulated data that reflects properties of real datasets (e.g., dispersion-mean trend) and develop an extensible framework for comprehensive testing of current and future methods. In addition, we explore the origin of such outliers, in some cases highlighting additional biological or technical factors within the experiment.

PEER takes as input transcript profiles and covariates from a set of individuals, and then outputs hidden factors that explain much of the expression variability. Optionally, these factors can be interpreted as pathway or transcription factor activations by providing prior information about which genes are involved in the pathway or targeted by the factor. The inferred factors are used in genetic association analyses. First, they are treated as additional covariates, and are included in the model to increase detection power for mapping expression traits. Second, they are analyzed as phenotypes themselves to understand the causes of global expression variability. PEER extends previous related surrogate variable models and can be implemented within hours on a desktop computer.},

abstract = {A common aim in ChIP-seq experiments is to identify changes in protein binding patterns between conditions, i.e. differential binding. A number of peak- and window-based strategies have been developed to detect differential binding when the regions of interest are not known in advance. However, careful consideration of error control is needed when applying these methods. Peak-based approaches use the same data set to define peaks and to detect differential binding. Done improperly, this can result in loss of type I error control. For window-based methods, controlling the false discovery rate over all detected windows does not guarantee control across all detected regions. Misinterpreting the former as the latter can result in unexpected liberalness. Here, several solutions are presented to maintain error control for these de novo counting strategies. For peak-based methods, peak calling should be performed on pooled libraries prior to the statistical analysis. For window-based methods, a hybrid approach using Simes' method is proposed to maintain control of the false discovery rate across regions. More generally, the relative advantages of peak- and window-based strategies are explored using a range of simulated and real data sets. Implementations of both strategies also compare favourably to existing programs for differential binding analyses.},

abstract = {The 15 known Fanconi anemia proteins cooperate in a pathway that regulates DNA interstrand cross-link repair. Recent studies indicate that the Fanconi anemia pathway also controls Rev1-mediated translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). We identified Fanconi anemia-associated protein (FAAP20), an integral subunit of the multisubunit Fanconi anemia core complex. FAAP20 binds to FANCA subunit and is required for stability of the complex and monoubiquitination of FANCD2. FAAP20 contains a ubiquitin-binding zinc finger 4 domain and binds to the monoubiquitinated form of Rev1. FAAP20 binding stabilizes Rev1 nuclear foci and promotes interaction of the Fanconi anemia core with PCNA-Rev1 DNA damage bypass complexes. FAAP20 therefore provides a critical link between the Fanconi anemia pathway and TLS polymerase activity. We propose that the Fanconi anemia core complex regulates cross-link repair by channeling lesions to damage bypass pathways and preventing large DNA insertions and deletions.},

It is a direct generalization of analysis of variance (ANOVA) for univariate data to the multivariate case. The method allows for easy interpretation of the variation induced by the different factors of the design. The method is illustrated with a dataset from a metabolomics experiment with time and dose factors.},

abstract = {The present study responds to the poor treatment given to dilatancy in classical rock mechanics post-failure problems such as tunnel or mine pillar design. A comprehensive review of the literature and observations in regard to published test results would indicate that dilatancy is highly dependent both on the plasticity already experienced by the material and confining stress; moreover, it also appears that scale may play a non-negligible role. In our article, we provide a detailed analysis of published test data with a view to proposing a sufficiently significant but conveniently simple formulation of the dilatancyangle that reflects these dependencies and that can be readily implemented in numerical codes. The model is then tested, demonstrating that it is capable of representing rock sample strain behaviour in compressive tests. Finally, the model is applied to the resolution of ground reaction curves for tunnels in poor-to-average-quality rock masses, showing a good correlation with results obtained using practical rock engineering techniques.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: RNA-Seq uses the high-throughput sequencing technology to identify and quantify transcriptome at an unprecedented high resolution and low cost. However, RNA-Seq reads are usually not uniformly distributed and biases in RNA-Seq data post great challenges in many applications including transcriptome assembly and the expression level estimation of genes or isoforms. Much effort has been made in the literature to calibrate the expression level estimation from biased RNA-Seq data, but the effect of biases on transcriptome assembly remains largely unexplored. RESULTS: Here, we propose a statistical framework for both transcriptome assembly and isoform expression level estimation from biased RNA-Seq data. Using a quasi-multinomial distribution model, our method is able to capture various types of RNA-Seq biases, including positional, sequencing and mappability biases. Our experimental results on simulated and real RNA-Seq datasets exhibit interesting effects of RNA-Seq biases on both transcriptome assembly and isoform expression level estimation. The advantage of our method is clearly shown in the experimental analysis by its high sensitivity and precision in transcriptome assembly and the high concordance of its estimated expression levels with qRT-PCR data.

Results: We review RNA-seq analysis tools at the sample, gene, transcript, and exon levels from a statistical perspective. We also highlight the biological and statistical questions of most practical considerations. Conclusion: The development of statistical and computational methods for analyzing RNA- seq data has made significant advances in the past decade. However, methods developed to answer the same biological question often rely on diverse statical models and exhibit different performance under different scenarios. This review discusses and compares multiple commonly used statistical models regarding their assumptions, in the hope of helping users select appropriate methods as needed, as well as assisting developers for future method development.},

abstract = {Removal of, or adjustment for, batch effects or center differences is generally required when such effects are present in data. In particular, when preparing microarray gene expression data from multiple cohorts, array platforms, or batches for later analyses, batch effects can have confounding effects, inducing spurious differences between study groups. Many methods and tools exist for removing batch effects from data. However, when study groups are not evenly distributed across batches, actual group differences may induce apparent batch differences, in which case batch adjustments may bias, usually deflate, group differences. Some tools therefore have the option of preserving the difference between study groups, e.g. using a two-way ANOVA model to simultaneously estimate both group and batch effects. Unfortunately, this approach may systematically induce incorrect group differences in downstream analyses when groups are distributed between the batches in an unbalanced manner. The scientific community seems to be largely unaware of how this approach may lead to false discoveries.},

While there can be significant advantages to analyzing RNA isolated from whole blood, particularly in clinical studies, the preparation of samples for microarray analysis is complicated by the need to minimize artifacts associated with highly abundant globin RNA transcripts. The impact of globin RNA transcripts on expression profiling data can potentially be reduced by using RNA preparation and labeling methods that remove or block globin RNA during the microarray assay. We compared four different methods for preparing microarray hybridization targets from human whole blood collected in PAXGene tubes.

In the fourth method cDNA targets were prepared with the Ovation amplification and labeling system.},

@article{Sun2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Differential expression analysis based on "next-generation" sequencing technologies is a fundamental means of studying RNA expression. We recently developed a multi-step normalization method (called TbT) for two-group RNA-seq data with replicates and demonstrated that the statistical methods available in four R packages (edgeR, DESeq, baySeq, and NBPSeq) together with TbT can produce a well-ranked gene list in which true differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are top-ranked and non-DEGs are bottom ranked. However, the advantages of the current TbT method come at the cost of a huge computation time. Moreover, the R packages did not have normalization methods based on such a multi-step strategy.

RESULTS: TCC (an acronym for Tag Count Comparison) is an R package that provides a series of functions for differential expression analysis of tag count data. The package incorporates multi-step normalization methods, whose strategy is to remove potential DEGs before performing the data normalization. The normalization function based on this DEG elimination strategy (DEGES) includes (i) the original TbT method based on DEGES for two-group data with or without replicates, (ii) much faster methods for two-group data with or without replicates, and (iii) methods for multi-group comparison. TCC provides a simple unified interface to perform such analyses with combinations of functions provided by edgeR, DESeq, and baySeq. Additionally, a function for generating simulation data under various conditions and alternative DEGES procedures consisting of functions in the existing packages are provided. Bioinformatics scientists can use TCC to evaluate their methods, and biologists familiar with other R packages can easily learn what is done in TCC.

CONCLUSION: DEGES in TCC is essential for accurate normalization of tag count data, especially when up- and down-regulated DEGs in one of the samples are extremely biased in their number. TCC is useful for analyzing tag count data in various scenarios ranging from unbiased to extremely biased differential expression. TCC is available at http://www.iu.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp/{\~{}}kadota/TCC/ and will appear in Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/) from ver. 2.13.},

This list is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation. Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance of predefined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology (GO). We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of this approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between the GO terms into the calculation of the statistical significance.

RESULTS: We present two novel algorithms that improve GO group scoring using the underlying GO graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both methods eliminate local dependencies between GO terms and point to relevant areas in the GO graph that remain undetected with state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a higher level of detecting relevant biological terms than competing methods.},

It is of particular importance to compare ChIP-seq data of two different conditions, such as disease vs. control, and identify regions that show differences in ChIP enrichment. We have developed a powerful and easy to use program, called diffReps, to detect those differential sites from ChIP-seq data, with or without biological replicates. In addition, we have developed two useful tools for ChIP-seq analysis in the diffReps package: one for the annotation of the differential sites and the other for finding chromatin modification "hotspots". diffReps is developed in PERL programming language and runs on all platforms as a command line script. We tested diffReps on two different datasets. One is the comparison of H3K4me3 between two human cell lines from the ENCODE project. The other is the comparison of H3K9me3 in a discrete region of mouse brain between cocaine- and saline-treated conditions. The results indicated that diffReps is a highly sensitive program in detecting differential sites from ChIP-seq data.},

We find that current computational methods can lead to hundreds of false positive results related to alternative isoform usage. This flaw in the current methodology stems from a lack of modeling sample-specific bias that leads to drops in coverage and is related to sequence features like fragment GC content and GC stretches. By incorporating features that explain this bias into transcript expression models, we greatly increase the specificity of transcript expression estimates, with more than a four-fold reduction in the number of false positives for reported changes in expression. We introduce alpine, a method for estimation of bias-corrected transcript abundance. The method is available as a Bioconductor package that includes data visualization tools useful for bias discovery.},

Correspondingly, a large number of statistical approaches for detecting gene set enrichment have been proposed, but both the interrelations and the relative performance of the various methods are still very much unclear.

RESULTS: We conduct an extensive survey of statistical approaches for gene set analysis and identify a common modular structure underlying most published methods. Based on this finding we propose a general framework for detecting gene set enrichment. This framework provides a meta-theory of gene set analysis that not only helps to gain a better understanding of the relative merits of each embedded approach but also facilitates a principled comparison and offers insights into the relative interplay of the methods.

CONCLUSION: We use this framework to conduct a computer simulation comparing 261 different variants of gene set enrichment procedures and to analyze two experimental data sets. Based on the results we offer recommendations for best practices regarding the choice of effective procedures for gene set enrichment analysis.},

abstract = {RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, eight of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20{\%}-40{\%} of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to {\textgreater}85{\%} for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve {\textgreater}85{\%} for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same eight tools successfully control their false discovery rate at ≲5{\%} for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining three tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that more than six biological replicates should be used, rising to more than 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If less than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makesedgeRthe leading tool. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important andDESeqmarginally outperforms the other tools.},

@article{Alexeyenko2012a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene-set enrichment analyses (GEA or GSEA) are commonly used for biological characterization of an experimental gene-set. This is done by finding known functional categories, such as pathways or Gene Ontology terms, that are over-represented in the experimental set; the assessment is based on an overlap statistic. Rich biological information in terms of gene interaction network is now widely available, but this topological information is not used by GEA, so there is a need for methods that exploit this type of information in high-throughput data analysis.

RESULTS: We developed a method of network enrichment analysis (NEA) that extends the overlap statistic in GEA to network links between genes in the experimental set and those in the functional categories. For the crucial step in statistical inference, we developed a fast network randomization algorithm in order to obtain the distribution of any network statistic under the null hypothesis of no association between an experimental gene-set and a functional category. We illustrate the NEA method using gene and protein expression data from a lung cancer study.

CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the NEA method is more powerful than the traditional GEA, primarily because the relationships between gene sets were more strongly captured by network connectivity rather than by simple overlaps.},

Yet, intrinsic limitations of the technology result in very sparse coverage of CpG sites (around 5{\%} to 20{\%} coverage), effectively limiting the analysis repertoire to a semi-quantitative level. Here we introduce Melissa (MEthyLation Inference for Single cell Analysis), a Bayesian hierarchical method to quantify spatially-varying methylation profiles across genomic regions from single-cell bisulfite sequencing data (scBS-seq). Melissa clusters individual cells based on local methylation patterns, enabling the discovery of epigenetic differences and similarities among individual cells. The clustering also acts as an effective regularisation method for imputation of methylation on unassayed CpG sites, enabling transfer of information between individual cells. We show both on simulated and real data sets that Melissa provides accurate and biologically meaningful clusterings, and state-of-the-art imputation performance.

@article{Turro2013,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Most methods for estimating differential expression from RNA-seq are based on statistics that compare normalized read counts between treatment classes. Unfortunately, reads are in general too short to be mapped unambiguously to features of interest, such as genes, isoforms or haplotype-specific isoforms. There are methods for estimating expression levels that account for this source of ambiguity. However, the uncertainty is not generally accounted for in downstream analysis of gene expression experiments. Moreover, at the individual transcript level, it can sometimes be too large to allow useful comparisons between treatment groups. RESULTS: In this article we make two proposals that improve the power, specificity and versatility of expression analysis using RNA-seq data. First, we present a Bayesian method for model selection that accounts for read mapping ambiguities using random effects. This polytomous model selection approach can be used to identify many interesting patterns of gene expression and is not confined to detecting differential expression between two groups. For illustration, we use our method to detect imprinting, different types of regulatory divergence in cis and in trans and differential isoform usage, but many other applications are possible. Second, we present a novel collapsing algorithm for grouping transcripts into inferential units that exploits the posterior correlation between transcript expression levels. The aggregate expression levels of these units can be estimated with useful levels of uncertainty. Our algorithm can improve the precision of expression estimates when uncertainty is large with only a small reduction in biological resolution.},

Most current methods that integrate these datasets allow for the computation of the correlation between a gene and protein but only after a one-to-one matching of genes and proteins is done. However, genes and proteins are connected via biological pathways and their relationship is not necessarily one-to-one. In this paper, we investigate the use of Correlated Factor Analysis (CFA) for modeling the correlation of genome-scale gene and protein data. Unlike existing approaches, CFA considers all possible gene-protein pairs and utilizes all gene and protein information in its modeling framework. The Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (gSVD) is another method which takes into account all available transcriptomic and proteomic data. Comparison is made between CFA and gSVD.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: In microarray gene expression studies, the number of replicated microarrays is usually small because of cost and sample availability, resulting in unreliable variance estimation and thus unreliable statistical hypothesis tests. The unreliable variance estimation is further complicated by the fact that the technology-specific variance is intrinsically intensity-dependent.

RESULTS: The Rosetta error model captures the variance-intensity relationship for various types of microarray technologies, such as single-color arrays and two-color arrays. This error model conservatively estimates intensity error and uses this value to stabilize the variance estimation. We present two commonly used error models: the intensity error-model for single-color microarrays and the ratio error model for two-color microarrays or ratios built from two single-color arrays. We present examples to demonstrate the strength of our error models in improving statistical power of microarray data analysis, particularly, in increasing expression detection sensitivity and specificity when the number of replicates is limited.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-seq is a powerful technique for identifying and quantifying transcription and splicing events, both known and novel. However, given its recent development and the proliferation of library construction methods, understanding the bias it introduces is incomplete but critical to realizing its value.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present a method, in vitro transcription sequencing (IVT-seq), for identifying and assessing the technical biases in RNA-seq library generation and sequencing at scale. We created a pool of over 1,000 in vitro transcribed RNAs from a full-length human cDNA library and sequenced them with polyA and total RNA-seq, the most common protocols. Because each cDNA is full length, and we show in vitro transcription is incredibly processive, each base in each transcript should be equivalently represented. However, with common RNA-seq applications and platforms, we find 50{\%} of transcripts have more than two-fold and 10{\%} have more than 10-fold differences in within-transcript sequence coverage. We also find greater than 6{\%} of transcripts have regions of dramatically unpredictable sequencing coverage between samples, confounding accurate determination of their expression. We use a combination of experimental and computational approaches to show rRNA depletion is responsible for the most significant variability in coverage, and several sequence determinants also strongly influence representation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These results show the utility of IVT-seq for promoting better understanding of bias introduced by RNA-seq. We find rRNA depletion is responsible for substantial, unappreciated biases in coverage introduced during library preparation. These biases suggest exon-level expression analysis may be inadvisable, and we recommend caution when interpreting RNA-seq results.},

@article{Aschoff2013,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Alternative splicing is central for cellular processes and substantially increases transcriptome and proteome diversity. Aberrant splicing events often have pathological consequences and are associated with various diseases and cancer types. The emergence of next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides an exciting new technology to analyse alternative splicing on a large scale. However, algorithms that enable the analysis of alternative splicing from short-read sequencing are not fully established yet and there are still no standard solutions available for a variety of data analysis tasks.

RESULTS: We present a new method and software to predict genes that are differentially spliced between two different conditions using RNA-seq data. Our method uses geometric angles between the high dimensional vectors of exon read counts. With this, differential splicing can be detected even if the splicing events are composed of higher complexity and involve previously unknown splicing patterns. We applied our approach to two case studies including neuroblastoma tumour data with favourable and unfavourable clinical courses. We show the validity of our predictions as well as the applicability of our method in the context of patient clustering. We verified our predictions by several methods including simulated experiments and complementary in silico analyses. We found a significant number of exons with specific regulatory splicing factor motifs for predicted genes and a substantial number of publications linking those genes to alternative splicing. Furthermore, we could successfully exploit splicing information to cluster tissues and patients. Finally, we found additional evidence of splicing diversity for many predicted genes in normalized read coverage plots and in reads that span exon-exon junctions.

RNA-Seq is a promising technology for analyzing alternative transcripts, as it does not require prior knowledge of transcript structures or genome sequences. However, analysis of RNA-Seq data in the presence of genes with large numbers of alternative transcripts is currently challenging due to efficiency, identifiability and representation issues.

RESULTS: We present RNA-Seq models and associated inference algorithms based on the concept of probabilistic splice graphs, which alleviate these issues. We prove that our models are often identifiable and demonstrate that our inference methods for quantification and differential processing detection are efficient and accurate.

abstract = {Nova proteins are a neuron-specific alternative splicing factors. We have combined bioinformatics, biochemistry and genetics to derive an RNA map describing the rules by which Nova proteins regulate alternative splicing. This map revealed that the position of Nova binding sites (YCAY clusters) in a pre-messenger RNA determines the outcome of splicing. The map correctly predicted Nova's effect to inhibit or enhance exon inclusion, which led us to examine the relationship between the map and Nova's mechanism of action. Nova binding to an exonic YCAY cluster changed the protein complexes assembled on pre-mRNA, blocking U1 snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein) binding and exon inclusion, whereas Nova binding to an intronic YCAY cluster enhanced spliceosome assembly and exon inclusion. Assays of splicing intermediates of Nova-regulated transcripts in mouse brain revealed that Nova preferentially regulates removal of introns harbouring (or closest to) YCAY clusters. These results define a genome-wide map relating the position of a cis-acting element to its regulation by an RNA binding protein, namely that Nova binding to YCAY clusters results in a local and asymmetric action to regulate spliceosome assembly and alternative splicing in neurons.},

abstract = {The transcriptional repressor Bcl-6 is linked to the development of both CD4(+) T follicular helper (TFH) and central memory T (TCM) cells. Here, we demonstrate that in response to decreased IL-2 signalling, T helper 1 (TH1) cells upregulate Bcl-6 and co-initiate TFH- and TCM-like gene programs, including expression of the cytokine receptors IL-6R$\alpha$ and IL-7R. Exposure of this potentially bi-potent cell population to IL-6 favours the TFH gene program, whereas IL-7 signalling represses TFH-associated genes including Bcl6 and Cxcr5, but not the TCM-related genes Klf2 and Sell. Mechanistically, IL-7-dependent activation of STAT5 contributes to Bcl-6 repression. Importantly, antigen-specific IL-6R$\alpha$(+)IL-7R(+) CD4(+) T cells emerge from the effector population at late time points post influenza infection. These data support a novel role for IL-7 in the repression of the TFH gene program and evoke a divergent regulatory mechanism by which post-effector TH1 cells may contribute to long-term cell-mediated and humoral immunity.},

In ChIP-seq experiments, ChIP samples are usually coupled with their matching control samples. Proper normalization between the ChIP and control samples is an essential aspect of ChIP-seq data analysis RESULTS: We have developed a data-adaptive method for estimating the normalization factor between the ChIP and the control samples. Our method, named as NCIS (Normalization of ChIP-Seq) can accommodate both low and high sequencing depth datasets. We compare statistical properties of NCIS against existing methods in a set of diverse simulation settings, where NCIS enjoys the best estimation precision. In addition, we illustrate the impact of the normalization factor in FDR control and show that NCIS leads to more power among methods that control FDR at nominal levels. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the proper normalization between the ChIP and control samples is an important step in ChIP-seq analysis in terms of power and error rate control. Our proposed method shows excellent statistical properties and is useful in the full range of ChIP-seq applications, especially with deeply sequenced data.},

Whitlock demonstrated that a weighted version of the inverse normal method, or 'weighted Z-test', is superior to Fisher's method for combining P-values for one-sided T-tests. The problem with Fisher's method is that it does not take advantage of weighting and loses power to the weighted Z-test when studies are differently sized. This issue was recently revisited by Chen, who observed that Lancaster's variation of Fisher's method had higher power than the weighted Z-test. Nevertheless, the weighted Z-test has comparable power to Lancaster's method when its weights are set to square roots of sample sizes. Power can be further improved when additional information is available. Although there is no single approach that is the best in every situation, the weighted Z-test enjoys certain properties that make it an appealing choice as a combination method for meta-analysis.},

abstract = {Alternative usage of exons provides genomes with plasticity to produce different transcripts from the same gene, modulating the function, localization, and life cycle of gene products. It affects most human genes. For a limited number of cases, alternative functions and tissue-specific roles are known. However, recent high-throughput sequencing studies have suggested that much alternative isoform usage across tissues is nonconserved, raising the question of the extent of its functional importance. We address this question in a genome-wide manner by analyzing the transcriptomes of five tissues for six primate species, focusing on exons that are 1:1 orthologous in all six species. Our results support a model in which differential usage of exons has two major modes: First, most of the exons show only weak differences, which are dominated by interspecies variability and may reflect neutral drift and noisy splicing. These cases dominate the genome-wide view and explain why conservation appears to be so limited. Second, however, a sizeable minority of exons show strong differences between tissues, which are mostly conserved. We identified a core set of 3,800 exons from 1,643 genes that show conservation of strongly tissue-dependent usage patterns from human at least to macaque. This set is enriched for exons encoding protein-disordered regions and untranslated regions. Our findings support the theory that isoform regulation is an important target of evolution in primates, and our method provides a powerful tool for discovering potentially functional tissue-dependent isoforms.},

@article{Dunkler2010a,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Univariate Cox regression (COX) is often used to select genes possibly linked to survival. With non-proportional hazards (NPH), COX could lead to under- or over-estimation of effects. The effect size measure c=P(T(1){\textless}T(0)), i.e. the probability that a person randomly chosen from group G(1) dies earlier than a person from G(0), is independent of the proportional hazards (PH) assumption. Here we consider its generalization to continuous data c' and investigate the suitability of c' for gene selection.

RESULTS: Under PH, c' is most efficiently estimated by COX. Under NPH, c' can be obtained by weighted Cox regression (WHE) or a novel method, concordance regression (CON). The least biased and most stable estimates were obtained by CON. We propose to use c' as summary measure of effect size to rank genes irrespective of different types of NPH and censoring patterns.

AVAILABILITY: WHE and CON are available as R packages.

abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been rapidly adopted for the profiling of transcriptomes in many areas of biology, including studies into gene regulation, development and disease. Of particular interest is the discovery of differentially expressed genes across different conditions (e.g., tissues, perturbations) while optionally adjusting for other systematic factors that affect the data-collection process. There are a number of subtle yet crucial aspects of these analyses, such as read counting, appropriate treatment of biological variability, quality control checks and appropriate setup of statistical modeling. Several variations have been presented in the literature, and there is a need for guidance on current best practices. This protocol presents a state-of-the-art computational and statistical RNA-seq differential expression analysis workflow largely based on the free open-source R language and Bioconductor software and, in particular, on two widely used tools, DESeq and edgeR. Hands-on time for typical small experiments (e.g., 4-10 samples) can be {\textless}1 h, with computation time {\textless}1 d using a standard desktop PC.},

abstract = {Kidney transplant recipients that develop signs of renal dysfunction or proteinuria one or more years after transplantation are at considerable risk for progression to renal failure. To assess the kidney at this time, a "for-cause" biopsy is performed, but this provides little indication as to which recipients will go on to organ failure. In an attempt to identify molecules that could provide this information, we used microarrays to analyze gene expression in 105 for-cause biopsies taken between 1 and 31 years after transplantation. Using supervised principal components analysis, we derived a molecular classifier to predict graft loss. The genes associated with graft failure were related to tissue injury, epithelial dedifferentiation, matrix remodeling, and TGF-beta effects and showed little overlap with rejection-associated genes. We assigned a prognostic molecular risk score to each patient, identifying those at high or low risk for graft loss. The molecular risk score was correlated with interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, tubulitis, interstitial inflammation, proteinuria, and glomerular filtration rate. In multivariate analysis, molecular risk score, peritubular capillary basement membrane multilayering, arteriolar hyalinosis, and proteinuria were independent predictors of graft loss. In an independent validation set, the molecular risk score was the only predictor of graft loss. Thus, the molecular risk score reflects active injury and is superior to either scarring or function in predicting graft failure.},

However, methods for the unsupervised integration of the resulting heterogeneous datasets are lacking. We present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA), a computational method for discovering the principal sources of variation in multi-omic datasets. MOFA infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability. It disentangles axes of heterogeneity that are shared across multiple modalities and those specific to individual data modalities. The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation, and the detection of outlier samples. We applied MOFA to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and ex-vivo drug responses. MOFA identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In a second application, we used MOFA to analyse single-cell multiomics data, identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation.},

The emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic changes have a key role in controlling the distinct transcriptional profiles of memory lymphocytes and thus in shaping their function.

Here, we combine second-generation sequencing and third-generation sequencing with a custom-designed method for isoform identification and quantification to generate a high-confidence isoform dataset for human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We report 8,084 RefSeq-annotated isoforms detected as full-length and an additional 5,459 isoforms predicted through statistical inference. Over one-third of these are novel isoforms, including 273 RNAs from gene loci that have not previously been identified. Further characterization of the novel loci indicates that a subset is expressed in pluripotent cells but not in diverse fetal and adult tissues; moreover, their reduced expression perturbs the network of pluripotency-associated genes. Results suggest that gene identification, even in well-characterized human cell lines and tissues, is likely far from complete.},

The first idea is use of Empirical Bayes (EB) methods to handle the large number of potentially-sparse effects, and estimate false discovery rates and related quantities. The second is use of factor analysis methods to deal with sources of unwanted variation such as batch effects and unmeasured confounders. We describe a simple modular fitting procedure that combines the key ideas from both these lines of research, and thus produce new and powerful EB methods for analyzing genomics experiments that can account for both large numbers of potentially-sparse effects and for sources of unwanted variation that can otherwise confound inference. In realistic simulations, these new methods provide significant gains in power and calibration over competing methods. In real data analysis we highlight that different methods, while often conceptually similar, can vary widely in their assessments of statistical significance, highlighting the need for care in both choice of methods and interpretation of results.},

abstract = {The circadian clock in mammals is driven by an autoregulatory transcriptional feedback mechanism that takes approximately 24 hours to complete. A key component of this mechanism is a heterodimeric transcriptional activator consisting of two basic helix-loop-helix PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) domain protein subunits, CLOCK and BMAL1. Here, we report the crystal structure of a complex containing the mouse CLOCK:BMAL1 bHLH-PAS domains at 2.3 {\AA} resolution. The structure reveals an unusual asymmetric heterodimer with the three domains in each of the two subunits--bHLH, PAS-A, and PAS-B--tightly intertwined and involved in dimerization interactions, resulting in three distinct protein interfaces. Mutations that perturb the observed heterodimer interfaces affect the stability and activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex as well as the periodicity of the circadian oscillator. The structure of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex is a starting point for understanding at an atomic level the mechanism driving the mammalian circadian clock.},

abstract = {Consider a multiple testing setup where we observe mutually independent pairs {\$}((P{\_}i, X{\_}i)){\_}{\{}1\backslashleq i \backslashleq m{\}}{\$} of p-values {\$}P{\_}i{\$} and covariates {\$}X{\_}i{\$}, such that {\$}P{\_}i \backslashperp X{\_}i{\$} under the null hypothesis. Our goal is to use the information potentially available in the covariates to increase power compared to conventional procedures that only use the {\$}P{\_}i{\$}, while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). To this end, we recently introduced independent hypothesis weighting (IHW), a weighted Benjamini-Hochberg method, in which the weights are chosen as a function of the covariate {\$}X{\_}i{\$} in a data-driven manner. We showed empirically in simulations and datasets from genomics and proteomics that IHW leads to a large power increase, while controlling the FDR. The key idea was to use hypothesis splitting to learn the weight-covariate function without overfitting. In this paper, we provide a survey of IHW and related approaches by presenting them under the lens of the two-groups model, when it is valid conditionally on a covariate. Furthermore, a slightly modified variant of IHW is proposed and shown to enjoy finite sample FDR control. The same ideas can also be applied for finite-sample control of the family-wise error rate (FWER) via IHW-Bonferroni.},

abstract = {An important goal of DNA microarray research is to develop tools to diagnose cancer more accurately based on the genetic profile of a tumor. There are several existing techniques in the literature for performing this type of diagnosis. Unfortunately, most of these techniques assume that different subtypes of cancer are already known to exist. Their utility is limited when such subtypes have not been previously identified. Although methods for identifying such subtypes exist, these methods do not work well for all datasets. It would be desirable to develop a procedure to find such subtypes that is applicable in a wide variety of circumstances. Even if no information is known about possible subtypes of a certain form of cancer, clinical information about the patients, such as their survival time, is often available. In this study, we develop some procedures that utilize both the gene expression data and the clinical data to identify subtypes of cancer and use this knowledge to diagnose future patients. These procedures were successfully applied to several publicly available datasets. We present diagnostic procedures that accurately predict the survival of future patients based on the gene expression profile and survival times of previous patients. This has the potential to be a powerful tool for diagnosing and treating cancer.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is used extensively to characterize the transcriptome of cells. Many transcriptomic studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest, such as genes or transcripts. Various quantification approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to inflated false discovery rates in differential gene expression analyses on simple count matrices but that this can be addressed by incorporating offsets derived from transcript-level abundance estimates. We also show that the problem is relatively minor in several real data sets. Finally, we provide an R package ( tximport) to help users integrate transcript-level abundance estimates from common quantification pipelines into count-based statistical inference engines.},

The processive formation of polymeric ubiquitin chains can accordingly be catalyzed by specialized initiating and elongating E2 enzymes, but the functional significance for this division of labor has remained unclear. Here, we have identified sequence motifs in several substrates of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) that are required for efficient chain initiation by its E2 Ube2C. Differences in the quality and accessibility of these chain initiation motifs can determine the rate of a substrate's degradation without affecting its affinity for the APC/C, a mechanism used by the APC/C to control the timing of substrate proteolysis during the cell cycle. Based on our results, we propose that initiation motifs and their cognate E2s allow E3 enzymes to exert precise temporal control over substrate degradation.},

abstract = {Roseolovirus, or human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), is a ubiquitous human pathogen infecting over 95{\%} of the population by the age of 2 years. As with other herpesviruses, reactivation of HHV-6 can present with severe complications in immunocompromised individuals. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of herpesvirus-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) in modulating both cellular and viral gene expression. An initial report which computed the likelihood of various viruses to encode miRNAs did not predict HHV-6 miRNAs. To experimentally screen for small HHV-6-encoded RNAs, we conducted large-scale sequencing of Sup-T-1 cells lytically infected with a laboratory strain of HHV-6B. This revealed an abundant, 60- to 65-nucleotide RNA of unknown function derived from the lytic origin of replication (OriLyt) that gave rise to smaller RNA species of 18 or 19 nucleotides. In addition, we identified four pre-miRNAs whose mature forms accumulated in Argonaute 2. In contrast to the case for other betaherpesviruses, HHV-6B miRNAs are expressed from direct repeat regions (DR(L) and DR(R)) located at either side of the genome. All miRNAs are conserved in the closely related HHV-6A variant, and one of them is a seed ortholog of the human miRNA miR-582-5p. Similar to alphaherpesvirus miRNAs, they are expressed in antisense orientation relative to immediate-early open reading frames (ORFs) and thus have the potential to regulate key viral genes.},

In many cases, it is not only different versions of annotations that need to be compared but also different sources of annotation of the same genome, derived from distinct gene prediction workflows. Such comparisons are of interest to annotation providers, prediction software developers, and end-users, who all need to assess what is common and what is different among distinct annotation sources. We developed ParsEval, a software application for pairwise comparison of sets of gene structure annotations. ParsEval calculates several statistics that highlight the similarities and differences between the two sets of annotations provided. These statistics are presented in an aggregate summary report, with additional details provided as individual reports specific to non-overlapping, gene-model-centric genomic loci. Genome browser styled graphics embedded in these reports help visualize the genomic context of the annotations. Output from ParsEval is both easily read and parsed, enabling systematic identification of problematic gene models for subsequent focused analysis.},

abstract = {Accurate and rapid identification of perturbed pathways through the analysis of genome-wide expression profiles facilitates the generation of biological hypotheses. We propose a statistical framework for determining whether a specified group of genes for a pathway has a coordinated association with a phenotype of interest. Several issues on proper hypothesis-testing procedures are clarified. In particular, it is shown that the differences in the correlation structure of each set of genes can lead to a biased comparison among gene sets unless a normalization procedure is applied. We propose statistical tests for two important but different aspects of association for each group of genes. This approach has more statistical power than currently available methods and can result in the discovery of statistically significant pathways that are not detected by other methods. This method is applied to data sets involving diabetes, inflammatory myopathies, and Alzheimer's disease, using gene sets we compiled from various public databases. In the case of inflammatory myopathies, we have correctly identified the known cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated autoimmunity in inclusion body myositis. Furthermore, we predicted the presence of dendritic cells in inclusion body myositis and of an IFN-alpha/beta response in dermatomyositis, neither of which was previously described. These predictions have been subsequently corroborated by immunohistochemistry.},

abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

New information on splice variation is becoming available through technology for measuring expression levels of several exons or splice junctions per gene. We have developed a statistical method, ANalysis Of Splice VAriation (ANOSVA) to detect alternative splicing from expression data. Since ANOSVA requires no transcript information, it can be applied when the level of annotation is poor. When validated against spiked clone data, it generated no false positives and few false negatives. We demonstrated ANOSVA with data from a prototype mouse alternative splicing array, run against normal adult tissues, yielding a set of genes with evidence of tissue-specific splice variation.

abstract = {The recent RNA-seq technology is an attractive method to study gene expression. One of the most important goals in RNA-seq data analysis is to detect genes differentially expressed across treatments. Although several statistical methods have been published, there are no theoretical justifications for whether these methods are optimal or how to search for the optimal test. Furthermore, most proposed tests are designed for testing whether the mean expression levels are exactly the same or not across treatments, whereas sometimes, biologists are interested in detecting genes with expression changes larger than a certain threshold. Another issue with current methods is that the false discovery rate (FDR) control is not well studied. In this manuscript, we propose a test to address all the above issues. Under model assumptions, we derive an optimal test that achieves the maximum of average power among those that control FDR at the same level. We also provide an approximated version, the approximated most average powerful (AMAP) test, for practical implementation. The proposed method allows for testing null hypotheses that are much more general than the ones most previous studies have considered, and it leads to a natural way of controlling the FDR. Through simulation studies, we show that our test has a higher power than other methods, including the widely-used edgeR, DESeq, and baySeq methods, as well as better FDR control than two other FDR control procedures commonly used in practice. For demonstration, we also apply the proposed method to a real RNA-seq dataset obtained from maize.},

This article reviews the current understanding of IFN-gamma ligand, receptor, signal transduction, and cellular effects with a focus on macrophage responses and to a lesser extent, responses from other cell types that influence macrophage function during infection. The current model for IFN-gamma signal transduction is discussed, as well as signal regulation and factors conferring signal specificity. Cellular effects of IFN-gamma are described, including up-regulation of pathogen recognition, antigen processing and presentation, the antiviral state, inhibition of cellular proliferation and effects on apoptosis, activation of microbicidal effector functions, immunomodulation, and leukocyte trafficking. In addition, integration of signaling and response with other cytokines and pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-4, type I IFNs, and lipopolysaccharide are discussed.},

abstract = {ChIP-seq technology is widely used in biomedical and basic science research. The main application is the detection of genomic regions that bind to a protein of interest. ChIP-Seq studies rely on peak calling algorithms that attempt to infer protein-binding sites by detecting genomic regions associated with more mapped reads (coverage) than expected by chance as a result of the experimental protocol's lack of perfect specificity. We find that GC-content bias accounts for a substantial amount of variability in the observed coverage for ChIP-Seq experiments and that this variability leads to false positive peak calls. More concerning is that the GC-effect varies across experiments, with the effect strong enough to result in a substantial number of peaks called differently when different laboratories perform experiments on the same cell-line. Although solutions have been proposed for GC-bias corrections in other Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) applications, accounting for GC-content in ChIP-Seq data is challenging because the binding sites of interest tend to be more common in high GC-content regions, which confounds real biological signal with the unwanted variability we want to remove. To account for this challenge we introduce a statistical approach, based on a mixture model, that accounts for GC-content effects on both non-specific noise and signal induced by the binding site we seek to detect. The method can be used to account for this bias in binding quantification as well to improve existing peak calling algorithms. We use this approach to show improved consistency across laboratories.

Over half of the alpha-globin structural variants reported to date are only characterized at the amino acid level. It is likely that a fraction of these variants, with phenotypes differing from one observation to another, may be due to the same mutation but on a different alpha-globin gene. There have been very few previous examples of hemoglobin variants that can be found at both HBA1 and HBA2 genes. Here, we report the results of a systematic multicenter study in a large multiethnic population to identify such variants and to analyze their differences from a functional and evolutionary perspective. We identified 14 different Hb variants resulting from identical mutations on either one of the two human alpha-globin paralogue genes. We also showed that the average percentage of hemoglobin variants due to a HBA2 gene mutation (alpha2) is higher than the percentage of hemoglobin variants due to the same HBA1 gene mutation (alpha1) and that the alpha2/alpha1 ratio varied between variants. These alpha-globin chain variants have most likely occurred via recurrent mutations, gene conversion events, or both. Based on these data, we propose a nomenclature for hemoglobin variants that fall into this category.},

Identification of protein binding sites from ChIP-seq data has required novel computational tools, distinct from those used for the analysis of ChIP-Chip experiments. The growing popularity of ChIP-seq spurred the development of many different analytical programs (at last count, we noted 31 open source methods), each with some purported advantage. Given that the literature is dense and empirical benchmarking challenging, selecting an appropriate method for ChIP-seq analysis has become a daunting task. Herein we compare the performance of eleven different peak calling programs on common empirical, transcription factor datasets and measure their sensitivity, accuracy and usability. Our analysis provides an unbiased critical assessment of available technologies, and should assist researchers in choosing a suitable tool for handling ChIP-seq data.},

Using two deeply sequenced data sets for human RNA polymerase II and STAT1, each with matching input-DNA controls, we describe a general scoring approach to address unique challenges in ChIP-seq data analysis. Our approach is based on the observation that sites of potential binding are strongly correlated with signal peaks in the control, likely revealing features of open chromatin. We develop a two-pass strategy called PeakSeq to compensate for this. A two-pass strategy compensates for signal caused by open chromatin, as revealed by inclusion of the controls. The first pass identifies putative binding sites and compensates for genomic variation in the 'mappability' of sequences. The second pass filters out sites not significantly enriched compared to the normalized control, computing precise enrichments and significances. Our scoring procedure enables us to optimize experimental design by estimating the depth of sequencing required for a desired level of coverage and demonstrating that more than two replicates provides only a marginal gain in information.},

In many cases -- especially when the number of observations is small relative to the number of variables -- some kind of shrinkage or regularization is necessary to improve estimation accuracy. Here, we propose an Empirical Bayes shrinkage approach, CorShrink, which adaptively learns how much to shrink correlations by combining information across all pairs of variables. One key feature of CorShrink, which distinguishes it from most existing methods, is its flexibility in dealing with missing data. Indeed, CorShrink explicitly accounts for varying amounts of missingness among pairs of variables. Numerical studies suggest CorShrink is competitive with other popular correlation shrinkage methods, even when there is no missing data. We illustrate CorShrink on gene expression data from GTEx project, which suffers from extensive missing observations, and where existing methods struggle. We also illustrate its flexibility by applying it to estimate cosine similarities between word vectors from word2vec models, thereby generating more accurate word similarity rankings.},

abstract = {Post-translational modifications of histone residue tails are an important component of genome regulation. It is becoming increasingly clear that the combinatorial presence and absence of various modifications define discrete chromatin states which determine the functional properties of a locus. An emerging experimental goal is to compare genome-wide chromatin state maps across different conditions, such as experimental treatments, cell-types or developmental time points. Here we present chromstaR, an algorithm for the computational inference of combinatorial chromatin state dynamics across an arbitrary number of conditions. ChromstaR uses a multivariate Hidden Markov Model to assign every genomic region to a discrete combinatorial chromatin state based on the presence/absence of each modification in every condition. This interpretation makes it easy to relate the inferred chromatin states back to the underlying histone modification patterns. Moreover, the algorithm computes the number of combinatorial chromatin states that are present in the genome without having to specify them a priori, thus providing an unbiased picture of their genome-wide frequencies. We demonstrate the advantages of chromstaR in the context of three common experimental data scenarios. First, we study how different histone modifications combine to form combinatorial chromatin states in a single tissue. Second, we infer genome-wide patterns of combinatorial state differences between two cell types or conditions. Finally, we study the dynamics of combinatorial chromatin states during tissue differentiation involving up to six differentiation points. chromstaR is a versatile computational tool that facilitates a deeper biological understanding of chromatin organization and dynamics. The algorithm is written in C++ and freely availableas an R-package at https://github.com/ataudt/chromstaR.},

Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that CAMERA recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms.

The microarray-based Infinium methylation assay by Illumina is one platform for low-cost high-throughput methylation profiling. Both Beta-value and M-value statistics have been used as metrics to measure methylation levels. However, there are no detailed studies of their relations and their strengths and limitations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We demonstrate that the relationship between the Beta-value and M-value methods is a Logit transformation, and show that the Beta-value method has severe heteroscedasticity for highly methylated or unmethylated CpG sites. In order to evaluate the performance of the Beta-value and M-value methods for identifying differentially methylated CpG sites, we designed a methylation titration experiment. The evaluation results show that the M-value method provides much better performance in terms of Detection Rate (DR) and True Positive Rate (TPR) for both highly methylated and unmethylated CpG sites. Imposing a minimum threshold of difference can improve the performance of the M-value method but not the Beta-value method. We also provide guidance for how to select the threshold of methylation differences.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The Beta-value has a more intuitive biological interpretation, but the M-value is more statistically valid for the differential analysis of methylation levels.

abstract = {The long-tailed macaque, also referred to as cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis), is one of the most important nonhuman primate animal models in basic and applied biomedical research. To improve the predictive power of primate experiments for humans, we determined the genome sequence of a Macaca fascicularis female of Mauritian origin using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach. We applied a template switch strategy that uses either the rhesus or the human genome to assemble sequence reads. The sixfold sequence coverage of the draft genome sequence enabled discovery of about 2.1 million potential single-nucleotide polymorphisms based on occurrence of a dimorphic nucleotide at a given position in the genome sequence. Homology-based annotation allowed us to identify 17,387 orthologs of human protein-coding genes in the M. fascicularis draft genome, and the predicted transcripts enabled the design of a M. fascicularis-specific gene expression microarray. Using liver samples from 36 individuals of different geographic origin we identified 718 genes with highly variable expression in liver, whereas the majority of the transcriptome shows relatively stable and comparable expression. Knowledge of the M. fascicularis draft genome is an important contribution to both the use of this animal in disease models and the safety assessment of drugs and their metabolites. In particular, this information allows high-resolution genotyping and microarray-based gene-expression profiling for animal stratification, thereby allowing the use of well-characterized animals for safety testing. Finally, the genome sequence presented here is a significant contribution to the global "3R" animal welfare initiative, which has the goal to reduce, refine, and replace animal experiments.},

The recently described use of flow cell sequencing devices in combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) stands to revolutionize the identification of DNA-protein interactions. As such, ChIP-seq is rapidly becoming the method of choice for the genome-wide localization of histone modifications and transcription factor binding sites. As further studies are performed, the information generated by ChIP-seq is expected to allow the development of a framework for networks describing the transcriptional regulation of cellular development and function. However, to date, this technology has been applied only to a small number of cell types, and even fewer tissues, suggesting a huge potential for novel discovery in this field.},

We present computational methods for fast detection of complex variants and splicing in short reads, based on a successively constrained search process of merging and filtering position lists from a genomic index. Our methods are implemented in GSNAP (Genomic Short-read Nucleotide Alignment Program), which can align both single- and paired-end reads as short as 14 nt and of arbitrarily long length. It can detect short- and long-distance splicing, including interchromosomal splicing, in individual reads, using probabilistic models or a database of known splice sites. Our program also permits SNP-tolerant alignment to a reference space of all possible combinations of major and minor alleles, and can align reads from bisulfite-treated DNA for the study of methylation state.},

The correct response to cytokines and a controlled balance of these populations is critical for the immune system and the avoidance of autoimmune disorders. To investigate how early cell-fate commitment is regulated, we generated the first human genome-wide maps of histone modifications that reveal enhancer elements after 72 hr of in vitro polarization toward T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) cell lineages. Our analysis indicated that even at this very early time point, cell-specific gene regulation and enhancers were at work directing lineage commitment. Further examination of lineage-specific enhancers identified transcription factors (TFs) with known and unknown T cell roles as putative drivers of lineage-specific gene expression. Lastly, an integrative analysis of immunopathogenic-associated SNPs suggests a role for distal regulatory elements in disease etiology.},

abstract = {Two intermingled hypothalamic neuron populations specified by expression of agouti-related peptide (AGRP) or pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) positively and negatively influence feeding behavior, respectively, possibly by reciprocally regulating downstream melanocortin receptors. However, the sufficiency of these neurons to control behavior and the relationship of their activity to the magnitude and dynamics of feeding are unknown. To measure this, we used channelrhodopsin-2 for cell type-specific photostimulation. Activation of only 800 AGRP neurons in mice evoked voracious feeding within minutes. The behavioral response increased with photoexcitable neuron number, photostimulation frequency and stimulus duration. Conversely, POMC neuron stimulation reduced food intake and body weight, which required melanocortin receptor signaling. However, AGRP neuron-mediated feeding was not dependent on suppressing this melanocortin pathway, indicating that AGRP neurons directly engage feeding circuits. Furthermore, feeding was evoked selectively over drinking without training or prior photostimulus exposure, which suggests that AGRP neurons serve a dedicated role coordinating this complex behavior.},

One multiple hypothesis testing error measure is the false discovery rate (FDR), which is loosely defined to be the expected proportion of false positives among all significant hypotheses. The FDR is especially appropriate for exploratory analyses in which one is interested in finding several significant results among many tests. In this work, we introduce a modified version of the FDR called the " positive false discovery rate " (pFDR). We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the pFDR and investigate its statistical properties. When assuming the test statistics follow a mixture distribution, we show that the pFDR can be written as a Bayesian posterior probability and can be connected to classification theory. These properties remain asymptotically true under fairly general conditions, even under certain forms of dependence. Also, a new quantity called the " q-value " is introduced and investigated, which is a natural " Bayesian posterior p-value, " or rather the pFDR analogue of the p-value.},

abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments now span hundreds to thousands of samples. A source of frustration for investigators analyzing a given dataset is the inability to rapidly and reproducibly align its samples jointly. Current spliced alignment software is designed to analyze each sample separately. Consequently, no information is gained from analyzing multiple samples together, and it is difficult to reproduce the exact analysis without access to original computing resources. We describe Rail-RNA, a cloud-enabled spliced aligner that analyzes many samples at once. Rail-RNA eliminates redundant work across samples, making it more efficient as samples are added. For many samples, Rail-RNA is more accurate than annotation-assisted aligners. We use Rail-RNA to align 666 RNA-seq samples from the GEUVADIS project on Amazon Web Services in 12 hours for US{\$}0.69 per sample. Rail-RNA produces alignments and base-resolution bigWig coverage files, ready for use with downstream packages for reproducible statistical analysis. We identify 290,416 expressed regions in the GEUVADIS samples, including 21,224 that map to intergenic sequence. We show that these regions show consistent patterns of variation across populations and with respect to known technological confounders. We identify expressed regions in the GEUVADIS samples and show that both annotated and unannotated (novel) expressed regions exhibit consistent patterns of variation across populations and with respect to known confounders.

abstract = {UNLABELLED: 

BACKGROUND: Identification of canonical pathways through enrichment of differentially expressed genes in a given pathway is a widely used method for interpreting gene lists generated from high-throughput experimental studies. However, most algorithms treat pathways as sets of genes, disregarding any inter- and intra-pathway connectivity information, and do not provide insights beyond identifying lists of pathways.

RESULTS: We developed an algorithm (PathNet) that utilizes the connectivity information in canonical pathway descriptions to help identify study-relevant pathways and characterize non-obvious dependencies and connections among pathways using gene expression data. PathNet considers both the differential expression of genes and their pathway neighbors to strengthen the evidence that a pathway is implicated in the biological conditions characterizing the experiment. As an adjunct to this analysis, PathNet uses the connectivity of the differentially expressed genes among all pathways to score pathway contextual associations and statistically identify biological relations among pathways. In this study, we used PathNet to identify biologically relevant results in two Alzheimer's disease microarray datasets, and compared its performance with existing methods. Importantly, PathNet identified de-regulation of the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway as an important component in Alzheimer's disease progression, despite the absence of this pathway in the standard enrichment analyses.

CONCLUSIONS: PathNet is a novel method for identifying enrichment and association between canonical pathways in the context of gene expression data. It takes into account topological information present in pathways to reveal biological information. PathNet is available as an R workspace image from http://www.bhsai.org/downloads/pathnet/.},

@article{Phipson2016,
abstract = {One of the most common analysis tasks in genomic research is to identify genes that are differentially expressed (DE) between experimental conditions. Empirical Bayes (EB) statistical tests using moderated genewise variances have been very effective for this purpose, especially when the number of biological replicate samples is small. The EB procedures can however be heavily influenced by a small number of genes with very large or very small variances. This article improves the differential expression tests by robustifying the hyperparameter estimation procedure. The robust procedure has the effect of decreasing the informativeness of the prior distribution for outlier genes while increasing its informativeness for other genes. This effect has the double benefit of reducing the chance that hypervariable genes will be spuriously identified as DE while increasing statistical power for the main body of genes. The robust EB algorithm is fast and numerically stable. The procedure allows exact small-sample null distributions for the test statistics and reduces exactly to the original EB procedure when no outlier genes are present. Simulations show that the robustified tests have similar performance to the original tests in the absence of outlier genes but have greater power and robustness when outliers are present. The article includes case studies for which the robust method correctly identifies and downweights genes associated with hidden covariates and detects more genes likely to be scientifically relevant to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in the limma software package freely available from the Bioconductor repository.},

abstract = {CpG islands (CGIs) are prominent in the mammalian genome owing to their GC-rich base composition and high density of CpG dinucleotides. Most human gene promoters are embedded within CGIs that lack DNA methylation and coincide with sites of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), irrespective of transcriptional activity. In spite of these intriguing correlations, the functional significance of non-methylated CGI sequences with respect to chromatin structure and transcription is unknown. By performing a search for proteins that are common to all CGIs, here we show high enrichment for Cfp1, which selectively binds to non-methylated CpGs in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of a mono-allelically methylated CGI confirmed that Cfp1 specifically associates with non-methylated CpG sites in vivo. High throughput sequencing of Cfp1-bound chromatin identified a notable concordance with non-methylated CGIs and sites of H3K4me3 in the mouse brain. Levels of H3K4me3 at CGIs were markedly reduced in Cfp1-depleted cells, consistent with the finding that Cfp1 associates with the H3K4 methyltransferase Setd1 (refs 7, 8). To test whether non-methylated CpG-dense sequences are sufficient to establish domains of H3K4me3, we analysed artificial CpG clusters that were integrated into the mouse genome. Despite the absence of promoters, the insertions recruited Cfp1 and created new peaks of H3K4me3. The data indicate that a primary function of non-methylated CGIs is to genetically influence the local chromatin modification state by interaction with Cfp1 and perhaps other CpG-binding proteins.},

abstract = {Butyrate-induced histone acetylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. However, the regulation mechanisms of histone modification remain largely unclear. To comprehensively analyze histone modification induced by butyrate, we utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technology combined with next-generation sequencing technology (ChIP-seq) to analyze histone modification (acetylation) induced by butyrate and to map the epigenomic landscape of normal histone H3 and acetylated histone H3K9 and H3K27 on a large scale. To determine the location of histone H3, acetyl-H3K9, and acetyl-H3K27 binding sites within the bovine genome, we analyzed the H3-, acetyl-H3K9-, and acetyl-H3K27-enriched binding regions in the proximal promoter within 5 kb upstream, or at the 5' untranslated region (UTR) from the transcriptional start site (TSS), exon, intron, and intergenic regions (defined as regions 25 kb upstream or 10 kb downstream from the TSS). Our analysis indicated that the distribution of histone H3, acetyl-H3K9, and acetyl-H3K27 correlated with transcription activity induced by butyrate. Using the GADEM algorithm, several motifs were generated for each of the ChIP-seq datasets. A de novo search for H3, acetyl-H3K9, and acetyl-H3K27 binding motifs indicated that histone modification (acetylation) at various locations changes the histone H3 binding preferences. Our results reveal that butyrate-induced acetylation in H3K9 and H3K27 changes the sequence-based binding preference of histone H3 and underlies the potential mechanisms of gene expression regulation induced by butyrate.},

With the use of polymerase evolution and design, we show that genetic information can be stored in and recovered from six alternative genetic polymers based on simple nucleic acid architectures not found in nature [xeno-nucleic acids (XNAs)]. We also select XNA aptamers, which bind their targets with high affinity and specificity, demonstrating that beyond heredity, specific XNAs have the capacity for Darwinian evolution and folding into defined structures.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Massive Parallel Sequencing methods (MPS) can extend and improve the knowledge obtained by conventional microarray technology, both for mRNAs and short non-coding RNAs, e.g. miRNAs. The processing methods used to extract and interpret the information are an important aspect of dealing with the vast amounts of data generated from short read sequencing. Although the number of computational tools for MPS data analysis is constantly growing, their strengths and weaknesses as part of a complex analytical pipe-line have not yet been well investigated. PRIMARY FINDINGS: A benchmark MPS miRNA dataset, resembling a situation in which miRNAs are spiked in biological replication experiments was assembled by merging a publicly available MPS spike-in miRNAs data set with MPS data derived from healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Using this data set we observed that short reads counts estimation is strongly under estimated in case of duplicates miRNAs, if whole genome is used as reference. Furthermore, the sensitivity of miRNAs detection is strongly dependent by the primary tool used in the analysis. Within the six aligners tested, specifically devoted to miRNA detection, SHRiMP and MicroRazerS show the highest sensitivity. Differential expression estimation is quite efficient. Within the five tools investigated, two of them (DESseq, baySeq) show a very good specificity and sensitivity in the detection of differential expression. CONCLUSIONS: The results provided by our analysis allow the definition of a clear and simple analytical optimized workflow for miRNAs digital quantitative analysis.},

The advent of exon and tiling microarrays means that researchers now have the capacity to experimentally measure alternative splicing on a genome wide level. New methods are needed to analyze the data from these arrays. RESULTS: We present a method, finding isoforms using robust multichip analysis (FIRMA), for detecting differential alternative splicing in exon array data. FIRMA has been developed for Affymetrix exon arrays, but could in principle be extended to other exon arrays, tiling arrays or splice junction arrays. We have evaluated the method using simulated data, and have also applied it to two datasets: a panel of 11 human tissues and a set of 10 pairs of matched normal and tumor colon tissue. FIRMA is able to detect exons in several genes confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR. AVAILABILITY: R code implementing our methods is contributed to the package aroma.affymetrix.},

@article{Zhu2007,
abstract = {Taking advantage of the complete genome sequences of several mammals, we developed a novel method to detect losses of well-established genes in the human genome through syntenic mapping of gene structures between the human, mouse, and dog genomes. Unlike most previous genomic methods for pseudogene identification, this analysis is able to differentiate losses of well-established genes from pseudogenes formed shortly after segmental duplication or generated via retrotransposition. Therefore, it enables us to find genes that were inactivated long after their birth, which were likely to have evolved nonredundant biological functions before being inactivated. The method was used to look for gene losses along the human lineage during the approximately 75 million years (My) since the common ancestor of primates and rodents (the euarchontoglire crown group). We identified 26 losses of well-established genes in the human genome that were all lost at least 50 My after their birth. Many of them were previously characterized pseudogenes in the human genome, such as GULO and UOX. Our methodology is highly effective at identifying losses of single-copy genes of ancient origin, allowing us to find a few well-known pseudogenes in the human genome missed by previous high-throughput genome-wide studies. In addition to confirming previously known gene losses, we identified 16 previously uncharacterized human pseudogenes that are definitive losses of long-established genes. Among them is ACYL3, an ancient enzyme present in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes, but lost approximately 6 to 8 Mya in the ancestor of humans and chimps. Although losses of well-established genes do not equate to adaptive gene losses, they are a useful proxy to use when searching for such genetic changes. This is especially true for adaptive losses that occurred more than 250,000 years ago, since any genetic evidence of the selective sweep indicative of such an event has been erased.},

@article{Robinson2010a,
abstract = {SUMMARY: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

abstract = {Gene expression measurements have successfully been used for building prognostic signatures, i.e for identifying a short list of important genes that can predict patient outcome. Mostly microarray measurements have been considered, and there is little advice available for building multivariable risk prediction models from RNA-Seq data. We specifically consider penalized regression techniques, such as the lasso and componentwise boosting, which can simultaneously consider all measurements and provide both, multivariable regression models for prediction and automated variable selection. However, they might be affected by the typical skewness, mean-variance-dependency or extreme values of RNA-Seq covariates and therefore could benefit from transformations of the latter. In an analytical part, we highlight preferential selection of covariates with large variances, which is problematic due to the mean-variance dependency of RNA-Seq data. In a simulation study, we compare different transformations of RNA-Seq data for potentially improving detection of important genes. Specifically, we consider standardization, the log transformation, a variance-stabilizing transformation, the Box-Cox transformation, and rank-based transformations. In addition, the prediction performance for real data from patients with kidney cancer and acute myeloid leukemia is considered. We show that signature size, identification performance, and prediction performance critically depend on the choice of a suitable transformation. Rank-based transformations perform well in all scenarios and can even outperform complex variance-stabilizing approaches. Generally, the results illustrate that the distribution and potential transformations of RNA-Seq data need to be considered as a critical step when building risk prediction models by penalized regression techniques.},

abstract = {Enrichment analysis of gene sets is a popular approach that provides a functional interpretation of genome-wide expression data. Existing tests are affected by inter-gene correlations, resulting in a high Type I error. The most widely used test, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, relies on computationally intensive permutations of sample labels to generate a null distribution that preserves gene-gene correlations. A more recent approach, CAMERA, attempts to correct for these correlations by estimating a variance inflation factor directly from the data. Although these methods generate P-values for detecting gene set activity, they are unable to produce confidence intervals or allow for post hoc comparisons. We have developed a new computational framework for Quantitative Set Analysis of Gene Expression (QuSAGE). QuSAGE accounts for inter-gene correlations, improves the estimation of the variance inflation factor and, rather than evaluating the deviation from a null hypothesis with a P-value, it quantifies gene-set activity with a complete probability density function. From this probability density function, P-values and confidence intervals can be extracted and post hoc analysis can be carried out while maintaining statistical traceability. Compared with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and CAMERA, QuSAGE exhibits better sensitivity and specificity on real data profiling the response to interferon therapy (in chronic Hepatitis C virus patients) and Influenza A virus infection. QuSAGE is available as an R package, which includes the core functions for the method as well as functions to plot and visualize the results.},

abstract = {Unwanted variation, including hidden confounding, is a well-known problem in many fields, particularly large-scale gene expression studies. Recent proposals to use control genes --- genes assumed to be unassociated with the covariates of interest --- have led to new methods to deal with this problem. Going by the moniker Removing Unwanted Variation (RUV), there are many versions --- RUV1, RUV2, RUV4, RUVinv, RUVrinv, RUVfun. In this paper, we introduce a general framework, RUV*, that both unites and generalizes these approaches. This unifying framework helps clarify connections between existing methods. In particular we provide conditions under which RUV2 and RUV4 are equivalent. The RUV* framework also preserves an advantage of RUV approaches --- their modularity --- which facilitates the development of novel methods based on existing matrix imputation algorithms. We illustrate this by implementing RUVB, a version of RUV* based on Bayesian factor analysis. In realistic simulations based on real data we found that RUVB is competitive with existing methods in terms of both power and calibration, although we also highlight the challenges of providing consistently reliable calibration among data sets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has emerged as a powerful approach for the detection of differential gene expression with both high-throughput and high resolution capabilities possible depending upon the experimental design chosen. Multiplex experimental designs are now readily available, these can be utilised to increase the numbers of samples or replicates profiled at the cost of decreased sequencing depth generated per sample. These strategies impact on the power of the approach to accurately identify differential expression. This study presents a detailed analysis of the power to detect differential expression in a range of scenarios including simulated null and differential expression distributions with varying numbers of biological or technical replicates, sequencing depths and analysis methods. RESULTS: Differential and non-differential expression datasets were simulated using a combination of negative binomial and exponential distributions derived from real RNA-Seq data. These datasets were used to evaluate the performance of three commonly used differential expression analysis algorithms and to quantify the changes in power with respect to true and false positive rates when simulating variations in sequencing depth, biological replication and multiplex experimental design choices. CONCLUSIONS: This work quantitatively explores comparisons between contemporary analysis tools and experimental design choices for the detection of differential expression using RNA-Seq. We found that the DESeq algorithm performs more conservatively than edgeR and NBPSeq. With regard to testing of various experimental designs, this work strongly suggests that greater power is gained through the use of biological replicates relative to library (technical) replicates and sequencing depth. Strikingly, sequencing depth could be reduced as low as 15{\%} without substantial impacts on false positive or true positive rates.},

abstract = {Recent developments in RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology have led to a rapid increase in gene expression data in the form of counts. RNA-seq can be used for a variety of applications, however, identifying differential expression (DE) remains a key task in functional genomics. There have been a number of statistical methods for DE detection for RNA-seq data. One common feature of several leading methods is the use of the negative binomial (Gamma-Poisson mixture) model. That is, the unobserved gene expression is modeled by a gamma random variable and, given the expression, the sequencing read counts are modeled as Poisson. The distinct feature in various methods is how the variance, or dispersion, in the Gamma distribution is modeled and estimated. We evaluate several large public RNA-seq datasets and find that the estimated dispersion in existing methods does not adequately capture the heterogeneity of biological variance among samples. We present a new empirical Bayes shrinkage estimate of the dispersion parameters and demonstrate improved DE detection.},

abstract = {We discuss the identification of genes that are associated with an outcome in RNA sequencing and other sequence-based comparative genomic experiments. RNA-sequencing data take the form of counts, so models based on the Gaussian distribution are unsuitable. Moreover, normalization is challenging because different sequencing experiments may generate quite different total numbers of reads. To overcome these difficulties, we use a log-linear model with a new approach to normalization. We derive a novel procedure to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR). Our method can be applied to data with quantitative, two-class, or multiple-class outcomes, and the computation is fast even for large data sets. We study the accuracy of our approaches for significance calculation and FDR estimation, and we demonstrate that our method has potential advantages over existing methods that are based on a Poisson or negative binomial model. In summary, this work provides a pipeline for the significance analysis of sequencing data.},

However, conclusions are often reached through inconsistent use or insufficient statistical analysis. To support researchers in their ROC curves analysis we developed pROC, a package for R and S+ that contains a set of tools displaying, analyzing, smoothing and comparing ROC curves in a user-friendly, object-oriented and flexible interface. With data previously imported into the R or S+ environment, the pROC package builds ROC curves and includes functions for computing confidence intervals, statistical tests for comparing total or partial area under the curve or the operating points of different classifiers, and methods for smoothing ROC curves. Intermediary and final results are visualised in user-friendly interfaces. A case study based on published clinical and biomarker data shows how to perform a typical ROC analysis with pROC. pROC is a package for R and S+ specifically dedicated to ROC analysis. It proposes multiple statistical tests to compare ROC curves, and in particular partial areas under the curve, allowing proper ROC interpretation. pROC is available in two versions: in the R programming language or with a graphical user interface in the S+ statistical software.

However, there are significant challenges in the analysis of RNA-seq data, such as how to separate signals from sequencing bias and how to perform reasonable normalization. Here, we focus on a fundamental question in RNA-seq analysis: the distribution of the position-level read counts. Specifically, we propose a two-parameter generalized Poisson (GP) model to the position-level read counts. We show that the GP model fits the data much better than the traditional Poisson model. Based on the GP model, we can better estimate gene or exon expression, perform a more reasonable normalization across different samples, and improve the identification of differentially expressed genes and the identification of differentially spliced exons. The usefulness of the GP model is demonstrated by applications to multiple RNA-seq data sets.},

In developing secondary xylem of the woody model Eucalyptus grandis, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 genomic spans were distinctly associated with xylogenesis-related processes, with (late) lignification pathways enriched for putative bivalent domains, but not early secondary cell wall polysaccharide deposition.

abstract = {Carefully designed control experiments provide a gold standard for benchmarking different genomics research tools. A shortcoming of many gene expression control studies is that replication involves profiling the same reference RNA sample multiple times. This leads to low, pure technical noise that is atypical of regular studies. To achieve a more realistic noise structure, we generated a RNA-sequencing mixture experiment using two cell lines of the same cancer type. Variability was added by extracting RNA from independent cell cultures and degrading particular samples. The systematic gene expression changes induced by this design allowed benchmarking of different library preparation kits (standard poly-A versus total RNA with Ribozero depletion) and analysis pipelines. Data generated using the total RNA kit had more signal for introns and various RNA classes (ncRNA, snRNA, snoRNA) and less variability after degradation. For differential expression analysis, voom with quality weights marginally outperformed other popular methods, while for differential splicing, DEXSeq was simultaneously the most sensitive and the most inconsistent method. For sample deconvolution analysis, DeMix outperformed IsoPure convincingly. Our RNA-sequencing data set provides a valuable resource for benchmarking different protocols and data pre-processing workflows. The extra noise mimics routine lab experiments more closely, ensuring any conclusions are widely applicable.},

@article{Boos2011,
abstract = {Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play crucial roles in promoting DNA replication and preventing rereplication in eukaryotic cells [1-4]. In budding yeast, CDKs promote DNA replication by phosphorylating two proteins, Sld2 and Sld3, which generates binding sites for pairs of BRCT repeats (breast cancer gene 1 [BRCA1] C terminal repeats) in the Dpb11 protein [5, 6]. The Sld3-Dpb11-Sld2 complex generated by CDK phosphorylation is required for the assembly and activation of the Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS (CMG) replicative helicase. In response to DNA replication stress, the interaction between Sld3 and Dpb11 is blocked by the checkpoint kinase Rad53 [7], which prevents late origin firing [7, 8]. Here we show that the two key CDK sites in Sld3 are conserved in the human Sld3-related protein Treslin/ticrr and are essential for DNA replication. Moreover, phosphorylation of these two sites mediates interaction with the orthologous pair of BRCT repeats in the human Dpb11 ortholog, TopBP1. Finally, we show that DNA replication stress prevents the interaction between Treslin/ticrr and TopBP1 via the Chk1 checkpoint kinase. Our results indicate that Treslin/ticrr is a genuine ortholog of Sld3 and that the Sld3-Dpb11 interaction has remained a critical nexus of S phase regulation through eukaryotic evolution.},

We demonstrated a direct role for histone modifications in alternative splicing. We found distinctive histone modification signatures that correlate with the splicing outcome in a set of human genes, and modulation of histone modifications causes splice site switching. Histone marks affect splicing outcome by influencing the recruitment of splicing regulators via a chromatin-binding protein. These results outline an adaptor system for the reading of histone marks by the pre-mRNA splicing machinery.},

abstract = {The ability to measure gene expression on a genome-wide scale is one of the most promising accomplishments in molecular biology. Microarrays, the technology that first permitted this, were riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of variability. Many of these problems are now mitigated, after a decade's worth of statistical methodology development. The recently developed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced variability in comparison to microarrays. However, we show that RNA-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays. In particular, we find guanine-cytosine content (GC-content) has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false positives in downstream results. We also report on commonly observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data normalization. Here, we describe a statistical methodology that improves precision by 42{\%} without loss of accuracy. Our resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic bias introduced by deterministic features such as GC-content and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions.},

@article{McCarthy2012,
abstract = {A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses.},

abstract = {The glucocorticoid receptor (GR), like other eukaryotic transcription factors, regulates gene expression by interacting with chromatinized DNA response elements. Photobleaching experiments in living cells indicate that receptors transiently interact with DNA on the time scale of seconds and predict that the response elements may be sparsely occupied on average. Here, we show that the binding of one receptor at the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) does not reduce the steady-state binding of another receptor variant to the same GRE. Mathematical simulations reproduce this noncompetitive state using short GR/GRE residency times and relatively long times between DNA binding events. At many genomic sites where GR binding causes increased chromatin accessibility, concurrent steady-state binding levels for the variant receptor are actually increased, a phenomenon termed assisted loading. Temporally sparse transcription factor-DNA interactions induce local chromatin reorganization, resulting in transient access for binding of secondary regulatory factors.},

@article{Hummel2008,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Several authors have studied expression in gene sets with specific goals: overrepresentation of interesting genes in functional groups, predictive power for class membership and searches for groups where the constituent genes show coordinated changes in expression under the experimental conditions. The purpose of this article is to follow the third direction. One important aspect is that the gene sets under analysis are known a priori and are not determined from the experimental data at hand. Our goal is to provide a methodology that helps to identify the relevant structural constituents (phenotypical, experimental design, biological component) that determine gene expression in a group.

RESULTS: Gene-wise linear models are used to formalize the structural aspects of a study. The full model is contrasted with a reduced model that lacks the relevant design component. A comparison with respect to goodness of fit is made and quantified. An asymptotic test and a permutation test are derived to test the null hypothesis that the reduced model sufficiently explains the observed expression within the gene group of interest. Graphical tools are available to illustrate and interpret the results of the analysis. Examples demonstrate the wide range of application.

abstract = {Gene set analysis (GSA) is used to elucidate genome-wide data, in particular transcriptome data. A multitude of methods have been proposed for this step of the analysis, and many of them have been compared and evaluated. Unfortunately, there is no consolidated opinion regarding what methods should be preferred, and the variety of available GSA software and implementations pose a difficulty for the end-user who wants to try out different methods. To address this, we have developed the R package Piano that collects a range of GSA methods into the same system, for the benefit of the end-user. Further on we refine the GSA workflow by using modifications of the gene-level statistics. This enables us to divide the resulting gene set P-values into three classes, describing different aspects of gene expression directionality at gene set level. We use our fully implemented workflow to investigate the impact of the individual components of GSA by using microarray and RNA-seq data. The results show that the evaluated methods are globally similar and the major separation correlates well with our defined directionality classes. As a consequence of this, we suggest to use a consensus scoring approach, based on multiple GSA runs. In combination with the directionality classes, this constitutes a more thorough basis for an enriched biological interpretation.},

abstract = {Summary: DNA methylation is an important mechanism regulating gene transcription, and its role in carcinogenesis has been extensively studied. Hyper and hypomethylation of genes is an alternative mechanism to deregulate gene expression in a wide range of diseases. At the same time, high-throughput DNA methylation assays have been developed generating vast amounts of genome wide DNA methylation measurements. Yet, few tools exist that can formally identify hypo and hypermethylated genes that are predictive of transcription and thus functionally relevant for a particular disease. To accommodate this lack of tools, we developed MethylMix, an algorithm implemented in R to identify disease specific hyper and hypomethylated genes. MethylMix is based on a beta mixture model to identify methylation states and compares them with the normal DNA methylation state. MethylMix introduces a novel metric, the ‘Differential Methylation value' or DM-value defined as the difference of a methylation state with the normal methylation state. Finally, matched gene expression data are used to identify, besides differential, transcriptionally predictive methylation states by focusing on methylation changes that effect gene expression.$\backslash$nAvailability and implementation: MethylMix was implemented as an R package and is available in bioconductor.$\backslash$nContact: olivier.gevaert@stanford.edu},

Eukaryotic Okazaki fragments remain poorly characterized and, because nucleosomes are rapidly deposited on nascent DNA, Okazaki fragment processing and nucleosome assembly potentially affect one another. Here we show that ligation-competent Okazaki fragments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are sized according to the nucleosome repeat. Using deep sequencing, we demonstrate that ligation junctions preferentially occur near nucleosome midpoints rather than in internucleosomal linker regions. Disrupting chromatin assembly or lagging-strand polymerase processivity affects both the size and the distribution of Okazaki fragments, suggesting a role for nascent chromatin, assembled immediately after the passage of the replication fork, in the termination of Okazaki fragment synthesis. Our studies represent the first high-resolution analysis--to our knowledge--of eukaryotic Okazaki fragments in vivo, and reveal the interconnection between lagging-strand synthesis and chromatin assembly.},

abstract = {Empirical analysis of statistical algorithms often demands time-consuming ex- periments which are best performed on high performance computing clusters. We present two R packages which greatly simplify working in batch computing envi- ronments. The package BatchJobs implements the basic objects and procedures to control a batch cluster within R . It is structured around cluster versions of the well-known higher order functions Map , Reduce and Filter from functional programming. An important feature is that the state of computation is persistently available in a database. The user can query the status of jobs and then continue working with a desired subset. The second package, BatchExperiments , is tailored for the still very general sce- nario of analyzing arbitrary algorithms on problem instances. It extends BatchJobs by letting the user define an array of jobs of the kind “apply algorithm A to prob- lem instance P and store results”. It is possible to associate statistical designs with parameters of algorithms and problems and therefore to systematically study their influence on the results. In general our main contributions are: (a) Portability : Both packages use a clear and well-defined interface to the batch system which makes them applicable in most high-performance computing environments. (b) Reproducibility : Every computational part has an associated seed that the user can control to ensure reproducibility even when the underlying batch system changes. (c) Efficiency : Efficiently use batch computing clusters completely within R . (d) Abstraction and good software design : The code layers for algorithms, experiment definitions and execution are cleanly separated and enable the writing of readable and maintainable code.},

To gain insights into this process, we generated base-pair-resolution mouse methylomes in stem cells and neuronal progenitors. Advanced quantitative analysis identified low-methylated regions (LMRs) with an average methylation of 30{\%}. These represent CpG-poor distal regulatory regions as evidenced by location, DNase I hypersensitivity, presence of enhancer chromatin marks and enhancer activity in reporter assays. LMRs are occupied by DNA-binding factors and their binding is necessary and sufficient to create LMRs. A comparison of neuronal and stem-cell methylomes confirms this dependency, as cell-type-specific LMRs are occupied by cell-type-specific transcription factors. This study provides methylome references for the mouse and shows that DNA-binding factors locally influence DNA methylation, enabling the identification of active regulatory regions.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Spotted arrays are often printed with probes in duplicate or triplicate, but current methods for assessing differential expression are not able to make full use of the resulting information. The usual practice is to average the duplicate or triplicate results for each probe before assessing differential expression. This results in the loss of valuable information about genewise variability.

RESULTS: A method is proposed for extracting more information from within-array replicate spots in microarray experiments by estimating the strength of the correlation between them. The method involves fitting separate linear models to the expression data for each gene but with a common value for the between-replicate correlation. The method greatly improves the precision with which the genewise variances are estimated and thereby improves inference methods designed to identify differentially expressed genes. The method may be combined with empirical Bayes methods for moderating the genewise variances between genes. The method is validated using data from a microarray experiment involving calibration and ratio control spots in conjunction with spiked-in RNA. Comparing results for calibration and ratio control spots shows that the common correlation method results in substantially better discrimination of differentially expressed genes from those which are not. The spike-in experiment also confirms that the results may be further improved by empirical Bayes smoothing of the variances when the sample size is small.

AVAILABILITY: The methodology is implemented in the limma software package for R, available from the CRAN repository http://www.r-project.org},

@article{Massa2010a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently, a great effort in microarray data analysis is directed towards the study of the so-called gene sets. A gene set is defined by genes that are, somehow, functionally related. For example, genes appearing in a known biological pathway naturally define a gene set. The gene sets are usually identified from a priori biological knowledge. Nowadays, many bioinformatics resources store such kind of knowledge (see, for example, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, among others). Although pathways maps carry important information about the structure of correlation among genes that should not be neglected, the currently available multivariate methods for gene set analysis do not fully exploit it.

RESULTS: We propose a novel gene set analysis specifically designed for gene sets defined by pathways. Such analysis, based on graphical models, explicitly incorporates the dependence structure among genes highlighted by the topology of pathways. The analysis is designed to be used for overall surveillance of changes in a pathway in different experimental conditions. In fact, under different circumstances, not only the expression of the genes in a pathway, but also the strength of their relations may change. The methods resulting from the proposal allow both to test for variations in the strength of the links, and to properly account for heteroschedasticity in the usual tests for differential expression.

CONCLUSIONS: The use of graphical models allows a deeper look at the components of the pathway that can be tested separately and compared marginally. In this way it is possible to test single components of the pathway and highlight only those involved in its deregulation.},

abstract = {Huntingtin (Htt) is a membrane-associated scaffolding protein that interacts with microtubule motors as well as actin-associated adaptor molecules. We examined a role for Htt in the dynein-mediated intracellular trafficking of endosomes and lysosomes. In HeLa cells depleted of either Htt or dynein, early, recycling, and late endosomes (LE)/lysosomes all become dispersed. Despite altered organelle localization, kinetic assays indicate only minor defects in intracellular trafficking. Expression of full-length Htt is required to restore organelle localization in Htt-depleted cells, supporting a role for Htt as a scaffold that promotes functional interactions along its length. In dynein-depleted cells, LE/lysosomes accumulate in tight patches near the cortex, apparently enmeshed by cortactin-positive actin filaments; Latrunculin B-treatment disperses these patches. Peripheral LE/lysosomes in dynein-depleted cells no longer colocalize with microtubules. Htt may be required for this off-loading, as the loss of microtubule association is not seen in Htt-depleted cells or in cells depleted of both dynein and Htt. Inhibition of kinesin-1 relocalizes peripheral LE/lysosomes induced by Htt depletion but not by dynein depletion, consistent with their detachment from microtubules upon dynein knockdown. Together, these data support a model of Htt as a facilitator of dynein-mediated trafficking that may regulate the cytoskeletal association of dynamic organelles.},

@article{Bourgon2010,
abstract = {With high-dimensional data, variable-by-variable statistical testing is often used to select variables whose behavior differs across conditions. Such an approach requires adjustment for multiple testing, which can result in low statistical power. A two-stage approach that first filters variables by a criterion independent of the test statistic, and then only tests variables which pass the filter, can provide higher power. We show that use of some filter/test statistics pairs presented in the literature may, however, lead to loss of type I error control. We describe other pairs which avoid this problem. In an application to microarray data, we found that gene-by-gene filtering by overall variance followed by a t-test increased the number of discoveries by 50{\%}. We also show that this particular statistic pair induces a lower bound on fold-change among the set of discoveries. Independent filtering-using filter/test pairs that are independent under the null hypothesis but correlated under the alternative-is a general approach that can substantially increase the efficiency of experiments.},

abstract = {Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites is an accurate method of identifying the location of genetic regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions. We employed high-throughput sequencing and whole-genome tiled array strategies to identify DNase I HS sites within human primary CD4+ T cells. Combining these two technologies, we have created a comprehensive and accurate genome-wide open chromatin map. Surprisingly, only 16{\%}-21{\%} of the identified 94,925 DNase I HS sites are found in promoters or first exons of known genes, but nearly half of the most open sites are in these regions. In conjunction with expression, motif, and chromatin immunoprecipitation data, we find evidence of cell-type-specific characteristics, including the ability to identify transcription start sites and locations of different chromatin marks utilized in these cells. In addition, and unexpectedly, our analyses have uncovered detailed features of nucleosome structure.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd. For many high-dimensional studies, additional information on the variables, like (genomic) annotation or external p-values, is available. In the context of binary and continuous prediction, we develop a method for adaptive group-regularized (logistic) ridge regression, which makes structural use of such 'co-data'. Here, 'groups' refer to a partition of the variables according to the co-data. We derive empirical Bayes estimates of group-specific penalties, which possess several nice properties: (i) They are analytical. (ii) They adapt to the informativeness of the co-data for the data at hand. (iii) Only one global penalty parameter requires tuning by cross-validation. In addition, the method allows use of multiple types of co-data at little extra computational effort. We show that the group-specific penalties may lead to a larger distinction between 'near-zero' and relatively large regression parameters, which facilitates post hoc variable selection. The method, termed GRridge, is implemented in an easy-to-use R-package. It is demonstrated on two cancer genomics studies, which both concern the discrimination of precancerous cervical lesions from normal cervix tissues using methylation microarray data. For both examples, GRridge clearly improves the predictive performances of ordinary logistic ridge regression and the group lasso. In addition, we show that for the second study, the relatively good predictive performance is maintained when selecting only 42 variables.},

abstract = {Transcriptomic assays that measure expression levels are widely used to study the manifestation of environmental or genetic variations in cellular processes. RNA-sequencing in particular has the potential to considerably improve such understanding because of its capacity to assay the entire transcriptome, including novel transcriptional events. However, as with earlier expression assays, analysis of RNA-sequencing data requires carefully accounting for factors that may introduce systematic, confounding variability in the expression measurements, resulting in spurious correlations. Here, we consider the problem of modeling and removing the effects of known and hidden confounding factors from RNA-sequencing data. We describe a unified residual framework that encapsulates existing approaches, and using this framework, present a novel method, HCP (Hidden Covariates with Prior). HCP uses a more informed assumption about the confounding factors, and performs as well or better than existing approaches while having a much lower computational cost. Our experiments demonstrate that accounting for known and hidden factors with appropriate models improves the quality of RNA-sequencing data in two very different tasks: detecting genetic variations that are associated with nearby expression variations (cis-eQTLs), and constructing accurate co-expression networks.},

abstract = {The initiation of chromosomal DNA replication involves initiator proteins that recruit and load hexameric DNA helicases at replication origins. This helicase loading step is tightly regulated in bacteria and eukaryotes. In contrast to the situation in bacteria, the eukaryotic helicase is loaded in an inactive form. This extra 'lock and load' mechanism in eukaryotes allows regulation of a second step, helicase activation. The temporal separation of helicase loading and activation is crucial for the coordination of DNA replication with cell growth and extracellular signals, the prevention of re-replication and the control of origin activity in response to replication stress. Initiator proteins in bacteria and eukaryotes are structurally homologous; yet the replicative helicases they load are unrelated. Understanding how these helicases are loaded and how they act during unwinding may have important implications for understanding how DNA replication is regulated in different domains of life.},

abstract = {The proto-oncogene KRAS is mutated in a wide array of human cancers, most of which are aggressive and respond poorly to standard therapies. Although the identification of specific oncogenes has led to the development of clinically effective, molecularly targeted therapies in some cases, KRAS has remained refractory to this approach. A complementary strategy for targeting KRAS is to identify gene products that, when inhibited, result in cell death only in the presence of an oncogenic allele. Here we have used systematic RNA interference to detect synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic KRAS and found that the non-canonical IkappaB kinase TBK1 was selectively essential in cells that contain mutant KRAS. Suppression of TBK1 induced apoptosis specifically in human cancer cell lines that depend on oncogenic KRAS expression. In these cells, TBK1 activated NF-kappaB anti-apoptotic signals involving c-Rel and BCL-XL (also known as BCL2L1) that were essential for survival, providing mechanistic insights into this synthetic lethal interaction. These observations indicate that TBK1 and NF-kappaB signalling are essential in KRAS mutant tumours, and establish a general approach for the rational identification of co-dependent pathways in cancer.},

In this study, we sought to assess the contribution of the different analytical steps involved in the analysis of RNA-seq data generated with the Illumina platform, and to perform a cross-platform comparison based on the results obtained through Affymetrix microarray. As a case study for our work we, used the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CEN.PK 113-7D, grown under two different conditions (batch and chemostat). Here, we asses the influence of genetic variation on the estimation of gene expression level using three different aligners for read-mapping (Gsnap, Stampy and TopHat) on S288c genome, the capabilities of five different statistical methods to detect differential gene expression (baySeq, Cuffdiff, DESeq, edgeR and NOISeq) and we explored the consistency between RNA-seq analysis using reference genome and de novo assembly approach. High reproducibility among biological replicates (correlation ≥0.99) and high consistency between the two platforms for analysis of gene expression levels (correlation ≥0.91) are reported. The results from differential gene expression identification derived from the different statistical methods, as well as their integrated analysis results based on gene ontology annotation are in good agreement. Overall, our study provides a useful and comprehensive comparison between the two platforms (RNA-seq and microrrays) for gene expression analysis and addresses the contribution of the different steps involved in the analysis of RNA-seq data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The causes and clinical course of acute rejection vary, and it is not possible to predict graft outcome reliably on the basis of available clinical, pathological, and genetic markers. We hypothesized that previously unrecognized molecular heterogeneity might underlie some of the variability in the clinical course of acute renal allograft rejection and in its response to treatment.

METHODS: We used DNA microarrays in a systematic study of gene-expression patterns in biopsy samples from normal and dysfunctional renal allografts. A combination of exploratory and supervised bioinformatic methods was used to analyze these profiles.

RESULTS: We found consistent differences among the gene-expression patterns associated with acute rejection, nephrotoxic effects of drugs, chronic allograft nephropathy, and normal kidneys. The gene-expression patterns associated with acute rejection suggested at least three possible distinct subtypes of acute rejection that, although indistinguishable by light microscopy, were marked by differences in immune activation and cellular proliferation. Since the gene-expression patterns pointed to substantial variation in the composition of immune infiltrates, we used immunohistochemical staining to define these subtypes further. This analysis revealed a striking association between dense CD20+ B-cell infiltrates and both clinical glucocorticoid resistance (P=0.01) and graft loss (P{\textless}0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: Systematic analysis of gene-expression patterns provides a window on the biology and pathogenesis of renal allograft rejection. Biopsy samples from patients with acute rejection that are indistinguishable on conventional histologic analysis reveal extensive differences in gene expression, which are associated with differences in immunologic and cellular features and clinical course. The presence of dense clusters of B cells in a biopsy sample was strongly associated with severe graft rejection, suggesting a pivotal role of infiltrating B cells in acute rejection.},

abstract = {We revisit the results of the recent Reproducibility Project: Psychology by the Open Science Collaboration. We compute Bayes factors—a quantity that can be used to express comparative evidence for an hypothesis but also for the null hypothesis—for a large subset (N = 72) of the original papers and their corresponding replication attempts. In our computation, we take into account the likely scenario that publication bias had distorted the originally published results. Overall, 75{\%} of studies gave qualitatively similar results in terms of the amount of evidence provided. However, the evidence was often weak (i.e., Bayes factor {\textless} 10). The majority of the studies (64{\%}) did not provide strong evidence for either the null or the alternative hypothesis in either the original or the replication, and no replication attempts provided strong evidence in favor of the null. In all cases where the original paper provided strong evidence but the replication did not (15{\%}), the sample size in the replication was smaller than the original. Where the replication provided strong evidence but the original did not (10{\%}), the replication sample size was larger. We conclude that the apparent failure of the Reproducibility Project to replicate many target effects can be adequately explained by overestimation of effect sizes (or overestimation of evidence against the null hypothesis) due to small sample sizes and publication bias in the psychological literature. We further conclude that traditional sample sizes are insufficient and that a more widespread adoption of Bayesian methods is desirable.},

abstract = {The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is an abundant primate species that diverged from the ancestors of Homo sapiens about 25 million years ago. Because they are genetically and physiologically similar to humans, rhesus monkeys are the most widely used nonhuman primate in basic and applied biomedical research. We determined the genome sequence of an Indian-origin Macaca mulatta female and compared the data with chimpanzees and humans to reveal the structure of ancestral primate genomes and to identify evidence for positive selection and lineage-specific expansions and contractions of gene families. A comparison of sequences from individual animals was used to investigate their underlying genetic diversity. The complete description of the macaque genome blueprint enhances the utility of this animal model for biomedical research and improves our understanding of the basic biology of the species.},

abstract = {Mapping the chromosomal locations of transcription factors, nucleosomes, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling enzymes, chaperones, and polymerases is one of the key tasks of modern biology, as evidenced by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project. To this end, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the standard methodology. Mapping such protein-DNA interactions in vivo using ChIP-seq presents multiple challenges not only in sample preparation and sequencing but also for computational analysis. Here, we present step-by-step guidelines for the computational analysis of ChIP-seq data. We address all the major steps in the analysis of ChIP-seq data: sequencing depth selection, quality checking, mapping, data normalization, assessment of reproducibility, peak calling, differential binding analysis, controlling the false discovery rate, peak annotation, visualization, and motif analysis. At each step in our guidelines we discuss some of the software tools most frequently used. We also highlight the challenges and problems associated with each step in ChIP-seq data analysis. We present a concise workflow for the analysis of ChIP-seq data in Figure 1 that complements and expands on the recommendations of the ENCODE and modENCODE projects. Each step in the workflow is described in detail in the following sections.},

abstract = {We introduce a new Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale hypothesis testing, including estimating False Discovery Rates (FDRs), and effect sizes. This approach has two key differences from existing approaches to FDR analysis. First, it assumes that the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal, with a mode at 0. This "unimodal assumption" (UA), although natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into standard FDR analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it brings many benefits. Specifically, the UA facilitates efficient and robust computation -- estimating the unimodal distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization problem -- and enables more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect size estimate, and corresponding standard error), rather than the one number usually used (p value, or z score). When available, using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates estimation of effects, and unlike standard FDR methods our approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition to measures of significance. To provide a bridge between interval estimates and significance measures we introduce the term "local false sign rate" to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong, and argue that it is a superior measure of significance than the local FDR because it is both more generally applicable, and can be more robustly estimated. Our methods are implemented in an R package ashr available from http://github.com/stephens999/ashr.},

abstract = {The RNA synthesis machinery of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) comprises the genomic RNA encapsidated by the viral nucleocapsid protein (N) and associated with the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, the viral components of which are a large protein (L) and an accessory phosphoprotein (P). The 241 kDa L protein contains all the enzymatic activities necessary for synthesis of the viral mRNAs, including capping, cap methylation and polyadenylation. Those RNA processing reactions are intimately coordinated with nucleotide polymerization such that failure to cap results in termination of transcription and failure to methylate can result in hyper polyadenylation. The mRNA processing reactions thus serve as a critical check point in viral RNA synthesis which may control the synthesis of incorrectly modified RNAs. Here, we report the length at which viral transcripts first gain access to the capping machinery during synthesis. By reconstitution of transcription in vitro with highly purified recombinant polymerase and engineered templates in which we omitted sites for incorporation of UTP, we found that transcripts that were 30-nucleotides in length were uncapped, whereas those that were 31-nucleotides in length contained a cap structure. The minimal RNA length required for mRNA cap addition was also sufficient for methylation since the 31-nucleotide long transcripts were methylated at both ribose-2'-O and guanine-N-7 positions. This work provides insights into the spatial relationship between the active sites for the RNA dependent RNA polymerase and polyribonucleotidyltransferase responsible for capping of the viral RNA. We combine the present findings with our recently described electron microscopic structure of the VSV polymerase and propose a model of how the spatial arrangement of the capping activities of L may influence nucleotide polymerization.},

abstract = {The nonhuman primates most commonly used in medical research are from the genus Macaca. To better understand the genetic differences between these animal models, we present high-quality draft genome sequences from two macaque species, the cynomolgus/crab-eating macaque and the Chinese rhesus macaque. Comparison with the previously sequenced Indian rhesus macaque reveals that all three macaques maintain abundant genetic heterogeneity, including millions of single-nucleotide substitutions and many insertions, deletions and gross chromosomal rearrangements. By assessing genetic regions with reduced variability, we identify genes in each macaque species that may have experienced positive selection. Genetic divergence patterns suggest that the cynomolgus macaque genome has been shaped by introgression after hybridization with the Chinese rhesus macaque. Macaque genes display a high degree of sequence similarity with human disease gene orthologs and drug targets. However, we identify several putatively dysfunctional genetic differences between the three macaque species, which may explain functional differences between them previously observed in clinical studies.},

abstract = {One of the early phases that lead to fibrosis progression is inflammation. Once this stage is resolved, fibrosis might be prevented. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) are emerging as a new therapy for several pathologies, including autoimmune diseases, because they enact immunosuppression. In this study we aimed to evaluate the role of BMMC administration in a model of kidney fibrosis induced by an acute injury. C57Bl6 mice were subjected to unilateral severe ischemia by clamping the left renal pedicle for 1h. BMMCs were isolated from femurs and tibia, and after 6h of reperfusion, 1 x 10(6) cells were administrated intraperitoneally. At 24h after surgery, treated animals showed a significant decrease in creatinine and urea levels when compared with untreated animals. Different administration routes were tested. Moreover, interferon (IFN) receptor knockout BMMCs were used, as this receptor is necessary for BMMC activation. Labeled BMMCs were found in ischemic kidney on FACS analysis. This improved outcome was associated with modulation of inflammation in the kidney and systemic modulation, as determined by cytokine expression profiling. Despite non-amelioration of functional parameters, kidney mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-6 at 6 weeks was lower in BMMC-treated animals, as were levels of collagen 1, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and vimentin. Protective molecules, such as IL-10, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and bone morphogenetic 7 (BMP-7), were increased in treated animals after 6 weeks. Moreover, Masson and Picrosirius red staining analyses showed less fibrotic areas in the kidneys of treated animals. Thus, early modulation of inflammation by BMMCs after an ischemic injury leads to reduced fibrosis through modulation of early inflammation.},

abstract = {In order to handle and interpret the vast amounts of data produced by microarray experiments, the analysis of sets of genes with a common biological functionality has been shown to be advantageous compared to single gene analyses. Some statistical methods have been proposed to analyse the differential gene expression of gene sets in microarray experiments. However, most of these methods either require threshhold values to be chosen for the analysis, or they need some reference set for the determination of significance. We present a method that estimates the number of differentially expressed genes in a gene set without requiring a threshold value for significance of genes. The method is self-contained (i.e., it does not require a reference set for comparison). In contrast to other methods which are focused on significance, our approach emphasizes the relevance of the regulation of gene sets. The presented method measures the degree of regulation of a gene set and is a useful tool to compare the induction of different gene sets and place the results of microarray experiments into the biological context. An R-package is available.},

@article{Wu2010c,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent technological advancements have made high throughput sequencing an increasingly popular approach for transcriptome analysis. Advantages of sequencing-based transcriptional profiling over microarrays have been reported, including lower technical variability. However, advances in technology do not remove biological variation between replicates and this variation is often neglected in many analyses.

RESULTS: We propose an empirical Bayes method, titled Analysis of Sequence Counts (ASC), to detect differential expression based on sequencing technology. ASC borrows information across sequences to establish prior distribution of sample variation, so that biological variation can be accounted for even when replicates are not available. Compared to current approaches that simply tests for equality of proportions in two samples, ASC is less biased towards highly expressed sequences and can identify more genes with a greater log fold change at lower overall abundance.

CONCLUSIONS: ASC unifies the biological and statistical significance of differential expression by estimating the posterior mean of log fold change and estimating false discovery rates based on the posterior mean. The implementation in R is available at http://www.stat.brown.edu/Zwu/research.aspx.},

Here we present a suite of techniques, based on ribosome profiling (the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments), to provide genome-wide maps of protein synthesis as well as a pulse-chase strategy for determining rates of translation elongation. We exploit the propensity of harringtonine to cause ribosomes to accumulate at sites of translation initiation together with a machine learning algorithm to define protein products systematically. Analysis of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals thousands of strong pause sites and unannotated translation products. These include amino-terminal extensions and truncations and upstream open reading frames with regulatory potential, initiated at both AUG and non-AUG codons, whose translation changes after differentiation. We also define a class of short, polycistronic ribosome-associated coding RNAs (sprcRNAs) that encode small proteins. Our studies reveal an unanticipated complexity to mammalian proteomes.},

@article{Bolstad2003,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: When running experiments that involve multiple high density oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations.

RESULTS: We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably.

AVAILABILITY: Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.

abstract = {Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data from sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads) extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the optimal location. When the read length is {\textless}160 bp, overlapping subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is sensitive because no individual subread is required to map exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It scales up efficiently for longer reads.},

abstract = {Permutation tests are amongst the most commonly used statistical tools in modern genomic research, a process by which p-values are attached to a test statistic by randomly permuting the sample or gene labels. Yet permutation p-values published in the genomic literature are often computed incorrectly, understated by about 1/m, where m is the number of permutations. The same is often true in the more general situation when Monte Carlo simulation is used to assign p-values. Although the p-value understatement is usually small in absolute terms, the implications can be serious in a multiple testing context. The understatement arises from the intuitive but mistaken idea of using permutation to estimate the tail probability of the test statistic. We argue instead that permutation should be viewed as generating an exact discrete null distribution. The relevant literature, some of which is likely to have been relatively inaccessible to the genomic community, is reviewed and summarized. A computation strategy is developed for exact p-values when permutations are randomly drawn. The strategy is valid for any number of permutations and samples. Some simple recommendations are made for the implementation of permutation tests in practice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-seq, a massive parallel-sequencing-based transcriptome profiling method, provides digital data in the form of aligned sequence read counts. The comparative analyses of the data require appropriate statistical methods to estimate the differential expression of transcript variants across different cell/tissue types and disease conditions.

RESULTS: We developed a novel nonparametric empirical Bayesian-based approach (NPEBseq) to model the RNA-seq data. The prior distribution of the Bayesian model is empirically estimated from the data without any parametric assumption, and hence the method is "nonparametric" in nature. Based on this model, we proposed a method for detecting differentially expressed genes across different conditions. We also extended this method to detect differential usage of exons from RNA-seq data. The evaluation of NPEBseq on both simulated and publicly available RNA-seq datasets and comparison with three popular methods showed improved results for experiments with or without biological replicates.

CONCLUSIONS: NPEBseq can successfully detect differential expression between different conditions not only at gene level but also at exon level from RNA-seq datasets. In addition, NPEBSeq performs significantly better than current methods and can be applied to genome-wide RNA-seq datasets. Sample datasets and R package are available at http://bioinformatics.wistar.upenn.edu/NPEBseq.},

abstract = {We present the results of a global study of dysregulated miRNAs in paired samples of normal mucosa and tumor from eight patients with colorectal cancer. Although there is existing data of miRNA contribution to colorectal tumorigenesis, these studies are typically small to medium scale studies of cell lines or non-paired tumor samples. The present study is to our knowledge unique in two respects. Firstly, the normal and adjacent tumor tissue samples are paired, thus taking into account the baseline differences between individuals when testing for differential expression. Secondly, we use high-throughput sequencing, thus enabling a comprehensive survey of all miRNAs expressed in the tissues. We use Illumina sequencing technology to perform sequencing and two different tools to statistically test for differences in read counts per gene between samples: edgeR when using the pair information and DESeq when ignoring this information, i.e., treating tumor and normal samples as independent groups. We identify 37 miRNAs that are significantly dysregulated in both statistical approaches, 19 down-regulated and 18 up-regulated. Some of these miRNAs are previously published as potential regulators in colorectal adenocarcinomas such as miR-1, miR-96 and miR-145. Our comprehensive survey of differentially expressed miRNAs thus confirms some existing findings. We have also discovered 16 dysregulated miRNAs, which to our knowledge have not previously been associated with colorectal carcinogenesis: the following significantly down-regulated miR-490-3p, -628-3p/-5p, -1297, -3151, -3163, -3622a-5p, -3656 and the up-regulated miR-105, -549, -1269, -1827, -3144-3p, -3177, -3180-3p, -4326. Although the study is preliminary with only eight patients included, we believe the results add to the present knowledge on miRNA dysregulation in colorectal carcinogenesis. As such the results would serve as a robust training set for validation of potential biomarkers in a larger cohort study. Finally, we also present data supporting the hypothesis that there are differences in miRNA expression between adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine tumors of the colon.},

abstract = {We implement a unique strategy for single molecule counting termed stochastic labeling, where random attachment of a diverse set of labels converts a population of identical DNA molecules into a population of distinct DNA molecules suitable for threshold detection. The conceptual framework for stochastic labeling is developed and experimentally demonstrated by determining the absolute and relative number of selected genes after stochastically labeling approximately 360,000 different fragments of the human genome. The approach does not require the physical separation of molecules and takes advantage of highly parallel methods such as microarray and sequencing technologies to simultaneously count absolute numbers of multiple targets. Stochastic labeling should be particularly useful for determining the absolute numbers of RNA or DNA molecules in single cells.},

abstract = {Spotted cDNA microarrays are emerging as a powerful and cost-effective tool for large-scale analysis of gene expression. Microarrays can be used to measure the relative quantities of specific mRNAs in two or more tissue samples for thousands of genes simultaneously. While the power of this technology has been recognized, many open questions remain about appropriate analysis of microarray data. One question is how to make valid estimates of the relative expression for genes that are not biased by ancillary sources of variation. Recognizing that there is inherent "noise" in microarray data, how does one estimate the error variation associated with an estimated change in expression, i.e., how does one construct the error bars? We demonstrate that ANOVA methods can be used to normalize microarray data and provide estimates of changes in gene expression that are corrected for potential confounding effects. This approach establishes a framework for the general analysis and interpretation of microarray data.},

@article{Jeanmougin2010,
abstract = {High-throughput post-genomic studies are now routinely and promisingly investigated in biological and biomedical research. The main statistical approach to select genes differentially expressed between two groups is to apply a t-test, which is subject of criticism in the literature. Numerous alternatives have been developed based on different and innovative variance modeling strategies. However, a critical issue is that selecting a different test usually leads to a different gene list. In this context and given the current tendency to apply the t-test, identifying the most efficient approach in practice remains crucial. To provide elements to answer, we conduct a comparison of eight tests representative of variance modeling strategies in gene expression data: Welch's t-test, ANOVA [1], Wilcoxon's test, SAM [2], RVM [3], limma [4], VarMixt [5] and SMVar [6]. Our comparison process relies on four steps (gene list analysis, simulations, spike-in data and re-sampling) to formulate comprehensive and robust conclusions about test performance, in terms of statistical power, false-positive rate, execution time and ease of use. Our results raise concerns about the ability of some methods to control the expected number of false positives at a desirable level. Besides, two tests (limma and VarMixt) show significant improvement compared to the t-test, in particular to deal with small sample sizes. In addition limma presents several practical advantages, so we advocate its application to analyze gene expression data.},

abstract = {We present the Scalable Nucleotide Alignment Program (SNAP), a new short and long read aligner that is both more accurate (i.e., aligns more reads with fewer errors) and 10-100x faster than state-of-the-art tools such as BWA. Unlike recent aligners based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform, SNAP uses a simple hash index of short seed sequences from the genome, similar to BLAST's. However, SNAP greatly reduces the number and cost of local alignment checks performed through several measures: it uses longer seeds to reduce the false positive locations considered, leverages larger memory capacities to speed index lookup, and excludes most candidate locations without fully computing their edit distance to the read. The result is an algorithm that scales well for reads from one hundred to thousands of bases long and provides a rich error model that can match classes of mutations (e.g., longer indels) that today's fast aligners ignore. We calculate that SNAP can align a dataset with 30x coverage of a human genome in less than an hour for a cost of {\$}2 on Amazon EC2, with higher accuracy than BWA. Finally, we describe ongoing work to further improve SNAP.},

The biochemical mediators of transcription are sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs), chromatin modifying enzymes, and chromatin, the complex of DNA and histone proteins. Covalent modification of DNA and histones, also termed epigenetic modification, influences the accessibility of target sequences for transcription factors on chromatin and the expression of linked genes required for immune functions. Genome-wide techniques such as ChIP-Seq have described the entire "cistrome" of transcription factors involved in specific developmental steps of B and T cells and started to define specific immune responses in terms of the binding profiles of critical effectors and epigenetic modification patterns. Current data suggest that both promoters and enhancers are prepared for action at different stages of activation by epigenetic modification through distinct transcription factors in different cells.},

Approximate REML methods are developed for estimation of the dispersion. The approximate REML methods can be implemented with very little added complication in a generalized linear model setting by adjusting the working vector and working weights. S-Plus functions for double generalized linear models are described. Through two data examples it is shown that the approximate REML methods are more robust than maximum likelihood, in the sense of being less sensitive to perturbations in the mean model.

The normal germinal centre B cell is the presumed cell of origin for both BL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), yet gene expression analysis suggests that these malignancies may use different oncogenic pathways. BL is subdivided into a sporadic subtype that is diagnosed in developed countries, the Epstein-Barr-virus-associated endemic subtype, and an HIV-associated subtype, but it is unclear whether these subtypes use similar or divergent oncogenic mechanisms. Here we used high-throughput RNA sequencing and RNA interference screening to discover essential regulatory pathways in BL that cooperate with MYC, the defining oncogene of this cancer. In 70{\%} of sporadic BL cases, mutations affecting the transcription factor TCF3 (E2A) or its negative regulator ID3 fostered TCF3 dependency. TCF3 activated the pro-survival phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway in BL, in part by augmenting tonic B-cell receptor signalling. In 38{\%} of sporadic BL cases, oncogenic CCND3 mutations produced highly stable cyclin D3 isoforms that drive cell cycle progression. These findings suggest opportunities to improve therapy for patients with BL.},

abstract = {To characterize the role of the circadian clock in mouse physiology and behavior, we used RNA-seq and DNA arrays to quantify the transcriptomes of 12 mouse organs over time. We found 43{\%} of all protein coding genes showed circadian rhythms in transcription somewhere in the body, largely in an organ-specific manner. In most organs, we noticed the expression of many oscillating genes peaked during transcriptional "rush hours" preceding dawn and dusk. Looking at the genomic landscape of rhythmic genes, we saw that they clustered together, were longer, and had more spliceforms than nonoscillating genes. Systems-level analysis revealed intricate rhythmic orchestration of gene pathways throughout the body. We also found oscillations in the expression of more than 1,000 known and novel noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Supporting their potential role in mediating clock function, ncRNAs conserved between mouse and human showed rhythmic expression in similar proportions as protein coding genes. Importantly, we also found that the majority of best-selling drugs and World Health Organization essential medicines directly target the products of rhythmic genes. Many of these drugs have short half-lives and may benefit from timed dosage. In sum, this study highlights critical, systemic, and surprising roles of the mammalian circadian clock and provides a blueprint for advancement in chronotherapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Various analytical methods exist that first quantify gene expression and then analyze differentially expressed genes from Affymetrix GeneChip gene expression analysis array data. These methods differ in the choice of probe measure (quantification of probe hybridization), summarizing multiple probe intensities into a gene expression value, and analysis of differential gene expression. Research papers that describe these methods focus on performance, and how their approaches differ from others. To better understand the common features and differences between various methods, and to evaluate their impact on the results of gene expression analysis, we describe a class of models, referred to as generalized probe models (GPMs), which encompass various currently available methods.

RESULTS: Using an empirical dataset, we compared different formulations of GPMs, and GPMs with three other commonly used methods, i.e. MAS 5.0, dChip, and RMA. The comparison shows that, on a genome-wide scale , different methods yield similar results if the same probe measures are chosen.

CONCLUSION: In this paper we present a general framework, i.e. GPMs, which encompasses various methods. GPMs permit the use of a wide range of probe measures and facilitate appropriate comparison between commonly used methods. We demonstrate that the dissimilar results stem primarily from different choice of probe measures, rather than other factors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The p53 transcription factor is located at the core of a complex wiring of signaling pathways that are critical for the preservation of cellular homeostasis. Only recently it has become clear that p53 regulates the expression of several long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs). However, relatively little is known about the role that lincRNAs play in this pathway. RESULTS Here we characterize a lincRNA named Pint (p53 induced noncoding transcript). We show that Pint is aubiquitously expressed lincRNA that is finely regulated by p53. In mouse cells, Pint promotes cell proliferation and survival by regulating the expression of genes of the TGF-b, MAPK and p53 pathways. Pint is a nuclear lincRNA that directly interacts with the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and is required for PRC2 targeting of specific genes for H3K27 tri-methylation and repression. Furthermore, Pint functional activity is highly dependent on PRC2 expression. We have also identified Pint human ortholog (PINT), which presents suggestive analogies with the murine lincRNA. PINT is similarly regulated by p53, and its expression significantly correlates with the same cellular pathways as the mouse ortholog, including the p53 pathway. Interestingly, PINT is downregulated in colon primary tumors, while its overexpression inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells, suggesting a possible role as tumor suppressor. CONCLUSIONS Our results reveal a p53 autoregulatory negative mechanism where a lincRNA connects p53 activation with epigenetic silencing by PRC2. Additionally, we show analogies and differences between the murine and human orthologs, identifying a novel tumor suppressor candidate lincRNA.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Chromatin states are the key to gene regulation and cell identity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is increasingly being used to map epigenetic states across genomes of diverse species. Chromatin modification profiles are frequently noisy and diffuse, spanning regions ranging from several nucleosomes to large domains of multiple genes. Much of the early work on the identification of ChIP-enriched regions for ChIP-Seq data has focused on identifying localized regions, such as transcription factor binding sites. Bioinformatic tools to identify diffuse domains of ChIP-enriched regions have been lacking. RESULTS: Based on the biological observation that histone modifications tend to cluster to form domains, we present a method that identifies spatial clusters of signals unlikely to appear by chance. This method pools together enrichment information from neighboring nucleosomes to increase sensitivity and specificity. By using genomic-scale analysis, as well as the examination of loci with validated epigenetic states, we demonstrate that this method outperforms existing methods in the identification of ChIP-enriched signals for histone modification profiles. We demonstrate the application of this unbiased method in important issues in ChIP-Seq data analysis, such as data normalization for quantitative comparison of levels of epigenetic modifications across cell types and growth conditions.

In spite of tremendous recent advances in computational gene finding, comprehensive annotation remains a challenge. Peptide mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for researching the dynamic proteome and suggests an attractive approach to discover and validate protein-coding genes. We present algorithms to construct and efficiently search spectra against a genomic database, with no prior knowledge of encoded proteins. By searching a corpus of 18.5 million tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) from human proteomic samples, we validate 39,000 exons and 11,000 introns at the level of translation. We present translation-level evidence for novel or extended exons in 16 genes, confirm translation of 224 hypothetical proteins, and discover or confirm over 40 alternative splicing events. Polymorphisms are efficiently encoded in our database, allowing us to observe variant alleles for 308 coding SNPs. Finally, we demonstrate the use of mass spectrometry to improve automated gene prediction, adding 800 correct exons to our predictions using a simple rescoring strategy. Our results demonstrate that proteomic profiling should play a role in any genome sequencing project.},

abstract = {Transcriptome studies based on quantitative sequencing can estimate levels of gene expression by measuring target RNA abundance in sequencing libraries. Sequencing costs are proportional to the total number of sequenced reads, and in order to cover rare RNAs, considerable quantities of abundant and identical reads are needed. This major limitation can be addressed by depleting a proportion of the most abundant sequences from the library. However, such depletion strategies involve either extra handling of the input RNA sample or use of a large number of reverse transcription primers, termed not-so-random (NSR) primers, which are costly to synthesize. Taking advantage of the high tolerance of reverse transcriptase to mis-prime, we found that it is possible to use as few as 40 pseudo-random (PS) reverse transcription primers to decrease the rate of undesirable abundant sequences within a library without affecting the overall transcriptome diversity. PS primers are simple to design and can be used to deplete several undesirable RNAs simultaneously, thus creating a flexible tool for enriching transcriptome libraries for rare transcript sequences.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene set analysis is moving towards considering pathway topology as a crucial feature. Pathway elements are complex entities such as protein complexes, gene family members and chemical compounds. The conversion of pathway topology to a gene/protein networks (where nodes are a simple element like a gene/protein) is a critical and challenging task that enables topology-based gene set analyses.Unfortunately, currently available R/Bioconductor packages provide pathway networks only from single databases. They do not propagate signals through chemical compounds and do not differentiate between complexes and gene families.

RESULTS: Here we present graphite, a Bioconductor package addressing these issues. Pathway information from four different databases is interpreted following specific biologically-driven rules that allow the reconstruction of gene-gene networks taking into account protein complexes, gene families and sensibly removing chemical compounds from the final graphs. The resulting networks represent a uniform resource for pathway analyses. Indeed, graphite provides easy access to three recently proposed topological methods. The graphite package is available as part of the Bioconductor software suite.

CONCLUSIONS: graphite is an innovative package able to gather and make easily available the contents of the four major pathway databases. In the field of topological analysis graphite acts as a provider of biological information by reducing the pathway complexity considering the biological meaning of the pathway elements.},

abstract = {Analysis of `big data' frequently involves statistical comparison of millions of competing hypotheses to discover hidden processes underlying observed patterns of data, for example in the search for genetic determinants of disease in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER) is considered the strongest protection against false positives, but makes it difficult to reach the multiple testing-corrected significance threshold. Here I introduce the harmonic mean p-value (HMP) which controls the FWER while greatly improving statistical power by combining dependent tests using generalized central limit theorem. I show that the HMP easily combines information to detect statistically significant signals among groups of individually nonsignificant hypotheses in examples of a human GWAS for neuroticism and a joint human-pathogen GWAS for hepatitis C viral load. The HMP simultaneously tests all combinations of hypotheses, allowing the smallest groups of hypotheses that retain significance to be sought. The power of the HMP to detect significant hypothesis groups is greater than the power of the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to detect significant hypotheses, even though the latter only controls the weaker false discovery rate (FDR). The HMP has broad implications for the analysis of large datasets because it enhances the potential for scientific discovery.},

abstract = {The analysis of climate data has relied heavily on hypothesis-driven statistical methods, while projections of future climate are based primarily on physics-based computational models. However, in recent years a wealth of new datasets has become available. Therefore, we take a more data-centric approach and propose a unified framework for studying climate, with an aim toward characterizing observed phenomena as well as discovering new knowledge in climate science. Specifically, we posit that complex networks are well suited for both descriptive analysis and predictive modeling tasks. We show that the structural properties of 'climate networks' have useful interpretation within the domain. Further, we extract clusters from these networks and demonstrate their predictive power as climate indices. Our experimental results establish that the network clusters are statistically significantly better predictors than clusters derived using a more traditional clustering approach. Using complex networks as data representation thus enables the unique opportunity for descriptive and predictive modeling to inform each other. 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

GREAT incorporates annotations from 20 ontologies and is available as a web application. Applying GREAT to data sets from chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) of multiple transcription-associated factors, including SRF, NRSF, GABP, Stat3 and p300 in different developmental contexts, we recover many functions of these factors that are missed by existing gene-based tools, and we generate testable hypotheses.

An important application of such tests is the detection of differentially expressed genes between two patient populations, as shifts in expression levels are expected to be coherent with the structure of graphs reflecting gene properties such as biological process, molecular function, regulation, or metabolism. For a fixed graph of interest, we demonstrate that accounting for graph structure can yield more powerful tests under the assumption of smooth distribution shift on the graph. We also investigate the identification of non-homogeneous subgraphs of a given large graph, which poses both computational and multiple testing problems. The relevance and benefits of the proposed approach are illustrated on synthetic data and on breast cancer gene expression data analyzed in context of KEGG pathways.},

@article{Gomes2014,
abstract = {The comprehension of protein and DNA binding in vivo is essential to understand gene regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) provides a global map of the regulatory binding network. Most ChIP-seq analysis tools focus on identifying binding regions from coverage enrichment. However, less work has been performed to infer the physical and regulatory details inside the enriched regions. This research extends a previous blind-deconvolution approach to develop a post-peak-calling algorithm that improves binding site resolution and predicts cooperative interactions. At the core of our new method is a physically motivated model that characterizes the binding signal as an extreme value distribution. This model suggests a mathematical framework to study physical properties of DNA shearing from the ChIP-seq coverage. The model explains the ChIP-seq coverage with two signals: The first considers DNA fragments with only a single binding event, whereas the second considers fragments with two binding events (a double-binding signal). The model incorporates motif discovery and is able to detect multiple sites in an enriched region with single-nucleotide resolution, high sensitivity, and high specificity. Our method improves peak caller sensitivity, from less than 45{\%} up to 94{\%}, at a false positive rate {\textless} 11{\%} for a set of 47 experimentally validated prokaryotic sites. It also improves resolution of highly enriched regions of large-scale eukaryotic data sets. The double-binding signal provides a novel application in ChIP-seq analysis: the identification of cooperative interaction. Predictions of known cooperative binding sites show a 0.85 area under an ROC curve.},

Sliding window methods that calculate moving averages of log ratios or t-statistics have been useful for the analysis of tiling array data. Here, we present a method that generalizes the moving average approach to evaluate sliding windows of p-values by using combined p-value statistics. In particular, the combined p-value framework can be useful in situations when taking averages of the corresponding test-statistic for the hypothesis may not be appropriate or when it is difficult to assess the significance of these averages. We exhibit the strengths of the combined p-values methods on Drosophila tiling array data and assess their ability to predict genomic regions enriched for transcription factor binding. The predictions are evaluated based on their proximity to target genes and their enrichment of known transcription factor binding sites. We also present an application for the generalization of the moving average based on integrating two different tiling array experiments.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic splicing structures are known to involve a high degree of alternative forms derived from a premature transcript by alternative splicing (AS). With the advent of new sequencing technologies, evidence for new splice forms becomes increasingly available-bit by bit revealing that the true splicing diversity of "AS events" often comprises more than two alternatives and therefore cannot be sufficiently described by pairwise comparisons as conducted in analyzes hitherto. Especially, I emphasize on "complete" AS events which include all hitherto known variants of a splicing variation. Challenges emerge from the richness of data (millions of transcripts) and artifacts introduced during the technical process of obtaining transcript sequences ("noise")-especially when dealing with single-read sequences known as expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Herein, I describe a novel method to efficiently predict AS events in different resolutions ("dimensions") from transcript annotations that allows for combination of fragmented EST data with full-length cDNAs and can cope with large datasets containing noise. At the doorstep of many new splice forms becoming available by novel high-throughput sequencing technologies, the presented method helps to dynamically update AS databases. Applying this method to estimate the real complexity of alternative splicing, I found in human and murine annotations thousands of novel AS events that either have been disregarded or mischaracterized in earlier works. The growth of evidence for such events suggests that the number still keeps climbing. When considering complete events, the majority of exons that are observed as "mutually exclusive" in pairwise comparisons in fact involves at least one other alternative splice form that disagrees with their mutual exclusion. Similar observations also hold for the alternative skipping of two subsequent exons. Results suggest that the systematical analysis of complete AS events on large scale provides subtle insights in the mechanisms that drive (alternative) splicing.},

Our SERRS nanoparticles consist of a 60-nm gold nanoparticle core that is encapsulated in a 15-nm-thick silica shell wherein the resonant Raman reporter is embedded. Subtle aspects of their preparation can shift their limit of detection by orders of magnitude. In this protocol, we present the optimized, step-by-step procedure for generating reproducible SERRS nanoparticles with femtomolar (10(-15) M) limits of detection. We provide ways of characterizing the optical properties of SERRS nanoparticles using UV/VIS and Raman spectroscopy, and their physicochemical properties using transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. We introduce several applications of these nanoprobes for biomedical research, with a focus on intraoperative cancer imaging via Raman imaging. A detailed account is provided for successful i.v. administration of SERRS nanoparticles such that delineation of cancerous lesions can be achieved in vivo and ex vivo on resected tissues without the need for specific biomarker targeting. This straightforward, yet comprehensive, protocol-from initial de novo gold nanoparticle synthesis to SERRS nanoparticle contrast-enhanced preclinical Raman imaging in animal models-takes ∼96 h.},

A necessary step when building a classifier for high-dimensional data is feature selection. Feature selection is frequently carried out by computing univariate scores for each feature individually, without consideration for how a subset of features performs as a whole. We introduce a new feature selection approach for high-dimensional nearest centroid classifiers that instead is based on the theoretically optimal choice of a given number of features, which we determine directly here. This allows us to develop a new greedy algorithm to estimate this optimal nearest-centroid classifier with a given number of features. In addition, whereas the centroids are usually formed from maximum likelihood estimates, we investigate the applicability of high-dimensional shrinkage estimates of centroids. We apply the proposed method to clinical classification based on gene-expression microarrays, demonstrating that the proposed method can outperform existing nearest centroid classifiers.},

abstract = {Gene annotation underpins genome science. Most often protein coding sequence is inferred from the genome based on transcript evidence and computational predictions. While generally correct, gene models suffer from errors in reading frame, exon border definition, and exon identification. To ascertain the error rate of Arabidopsis thaliana gene models, we isolated proteins from a sample of Arabidopsis tissues and determined the amino acid sequences of 144,079 distinct peptides by tandem mass spectrometry. The peptides corresponded to 1 or more of 3 different translations of the genome: a 6-frame translation, an exon splice-graph, and the currently annotated proteome. The majority of the peptides (126,055) resided in existing gene models (12,769 confirmed proteins), comprising 40{\%} of annotated genes. Surprisingly, 18,024 novel peptides were found that do not correspond to annotated genes. Using the gene finding program AUGUSTUS and 5,426 novel peptides that occurred in clusters, we discovered 778 new protein-coding genes and refined the annotation of an additional 695 gene models. The remaining 13,449 novel peptides provide high quality annotation ({\textgreater}99{\%} correct) for thousands of additional genes. Our observation that 18,024 of 144,079 peptides did not match current gene models suggests that 13{\%} of the Arabidopsis proteome was incomplete due to approximately equal numbers of missing and incorrect gene models.},

abstract = {Multiple-hypothesis testing involves guarding against much more complicated errors than single-hypothesis testing. Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach—we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR method.},

abstract = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a flexible technology for measuring genome-wide expression that is rapidly replacing microarrays as costs become comparable. Current differential expression analysis methods for RNA-seq data fall into two broad classes: (1) methods that quantify expression within the boundaries of genes previously published in databases and (2) methods that attempt to reconstruct full length RNA transcripts. The first class cannot discover differential expression outside of previously known genes. While the second approach does possess discovery capabilities, statistical analysis of differential expression is complicated by the ambiguity and variability incurred while assembling transcripts and estimating their abundances. Here, we propose a novel method that first identifies differentially expressed regions (DERs) of interest by assessing differential expression at each base of the genome. The method then segments the genome into regions comprised of bases showing similar differential expression signal, and then assigns a measure of statistical significance to each region. Optionally, DERs can be annotated using a reference database of genomic features. We compare our approach with leading competitors from both current classes of differential expression methods and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each. A software implementation of our method is available on github (https://github.com/alyssafrazee/derfinder).},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (exceeding 80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously un-described RNA-seq alignment algorithm which utilizes sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by more than a factor of 50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 Million 2x76bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of RT-PCR amplicons, we experimentally validated 1,960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.Implementation and AVAILABILITY: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

Melissa clusters individual cells based on local methylation patterns, enabling the discovery of epigenetic differences and similarities among individual cells. The clustering also acts as an effective regularisation method for imputation of methylation on unassayed CpG sites, enabling transfer of information between individual cells. We show both on simulated and real data sets that Melissa provides accurate and biologically meaningful clusterings, and state-of-the-art imputation performance.

abstract = {Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) is a conserved feature of active chromatin catalyzed by methyltransferases of the SET1-family (SET1A, SET1B, MLL1, MLL2, MLL3 and MLL4 in humans). These enzymes participate in diverse gene regulatory networks with a multitude of known biological functions, including direct involvement in several human disease states. Unlike most lysine methyltransferases, SET1-family enzymes are only fully active in the context of a multi-subunit complex, which includes a protein module comprised of WDR5, RbBP5, ASH2L and DPY-30 (WRAD). These proteins bind in close proximity to the catalytic SET domain of SET1-family enzymes and stimulate H3K4 methyltransferase activity. The mechanism by which WRAD promotes catalysis involves elements of allosteric control and possibly the utilization of a second H3K4 methyltransferase active site present within WRAD itself. WRAD components also engage in physical interactions that recruit SET1-family proteins to target sites on chromatin. Here, the known molecular mechanisms through which WRAD enables the function of SET1-related enzymes will be reviewed.},

@article{Fernandes2013,
abstract = {Experimental variance is a major challenge when dealing with high-throughput sequencing data. This variance has several sources: sampling replication, technical replication, variability within biological conditions, and variability between biological conditions. The high per-sample cost of RNA-Seq often precludes the large number of experiments needed to partition observed variance into these categories as per standard ANOVA models. We show that the partitioning of within-condition to between-condition variation cannot reasonably be ignored, whether in single-organism RNA-Seq or in Meta-RNA-Seq experiments, and further find that commonly-used RNA-Seq analysis tools, as described in the literature, do not enforce the constraint that the sum of relative expression levels must be one, and thus report expression levels that are systematically distorted. These two factors lead to misleading inferences if not properly accommodated. As it is usually only the biological between-condition and within-condition differences that are of interest, we developed ALDEx, an ANOVA-like differential expression procedure, to identify genes with greater between- to within-condition differences. We show that the presence of differential expression and the magnitude of these comparative differences can be reasonably estimated with even very small sample sizes.},

abstract = {Innate immune response involves protein-protein interactions, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-protein interactions and signaling cascades. So far, thousands of protein-protein interactions have been curated as a static interaction map. However, protein-protein interactions involved in innate immune response are dynamic. We recorded the dynamics in the interactome during innate immune response by combining gene expression data of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated dendritic cells with protein-protein interactions data. We identified the differences in interactome during innate immune response by constructing differential networks and identifying protein modules, which were up-/down-regulated at each stage during the innate immune response. For each protein complex, we identified enriched biological processes and pathways. In addition, we identified core interactions that are conserved throughout the innate immune response and their enriched gene ontology terms and pathways. We defined two novel measures to assess the differences between network maps at different time points. We found that the protein interaction network at 1 hour after LPS stimulation has the highest interactions protein ratio, which indicates a role for proteins with large number of interactions in innate immune response. A pairwise differential matrix allows for the global visualization of the differences between different networks. We investigated the toll-like receptor subnetwork and found that S100A8 is down-regulated in dendritic cells after LPS stimulation. Identified protein complexes have a crucial role not only in innate immunity, but also in circadian rhythms, pathways involved in cancer, and p53 pathways. The study confirmed previous work that reported a strong correlation between cancer and immunity.},

In total, we compared 26 mapping protocols based on 11 programs and pipelines and found major performance differences between methods on numerous benchmarks, including alignment yield, basewise accuracy, mismatch and gap placement, exon junction discovery and suitability of alignments for transcript reconstruction. We observed concordant results on real and simulated RNA-seq data, confirming the relevance of the metrics employed.

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

abstract = {The RNA transcriptome varies in response to cellular differentiation as well as environmental factors, and can be characterized by the diversity and abundance of transcript isoforms. Differential transcription analysis, the detection of differences between the transcriptomes of different cells, may improve understanding of cell differentiation and development and enable the identification of biomarkers that classify disease types. The availability of high-throughput short-read RNA sequencing technologies provides in-depth sampling of the transcriptome, making it possible to accurately detect the differences between transcriptomes. In this article, we present a new method for the detection and visualization of differential transcription. Our approach does not depend on transcript or gene annotations. It also circumvents the need for full transcript inference and quantification, which is a challenging problem because of short read lengths, as well as various sampling biases. Instead, our method takes a divide-and-conquer approach to localize the difference between transcriptomes in the form of alternative splicing modules (ASMs), where transcript isoforms diverge. Our approach starts with the identification of ASMs from the splice graph, constructed directly from the exons and introns predicted from RNA-seq read alignments. The abundance of alternative splicing isoforms residing in each ASM is estimated for each sample and is compared across sample groups. A non-parametric statistical test is applied to each ASM to detect significant differential transcription with a controlled false discovery rate. The sensitivity and specificity of the method have been assessed using simulated data sets and compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Experimental validation using qRT-PCR confirmed a selected set of genes that are differentially expressed in a lung differentiation study and a breast cancer data set, demonstrating the utility of the approach applied on experimental biological data sets.

abstract = {It has unambiguously been shown that genetic, environmental, demographic, and technical factors may have substantial effects on gene expression levels. In addition to the measured variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated to capture through simple models. We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. We introduce "surrogate variable analysis" (SVA) to overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. SVA can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply SVA to disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression studies. We show that SVA increases the biological accuracy and reproducibility of analyses in genome-wide expression studies.},

The data reveal two DNA damage response pathways not previously observed upon deletion of individual shelterin proteins. The shelterin-free telomeres are processed by microhomology-mediated alternative-NHEJ when Ku70/80 is absent and are attacked by nucleolytic degradation in the absence of 53BP1. The data establish that the end-protection problem is specified by six pathways [ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related) signaling, classical-NHEJ, alt-NHEJ, homologous recombination, and resection] and show how shelterin acts with general DNA damage response factors to solve this problem.},

abstract = {Validating statistical analysis methods for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments is a complex task. Researchers often find themselves having to decide between competing models or assessing the reliability of results obtained with a designated analysis program. Computer simulation has been the most frequently used procedure to verify the adequacy of a model. However, datasets generated by simulations depend on the parameterization and the assumptions of the selected model. Moreover, such datasets may constitute a partial representation of reality as the complexity or RNA-seq data is hard to mimic. We present the use of plasmode datasets to complement the evaluation of statistical models for RNA-seq data. A plasmode is a dataset obtained from experimental data but for which come truth is known. Using a set of simulated scenarios of technical and biological replicates, and public available datasets, we illustrate how to design algorithms to construct plasmodes under different experimental conditions. We contrast results from two types of methods for RNA-seq: (1) models based on negative binomial distribution (edgeR and DESeq), and (2) Gaussian models applied after transformation of data (MAANOVA). Results emphasize the fact that deciding what method to use may be experiment-specific due to the unknown distributions of expression levels. Plasmodes may contribute to choose which method to apply by using a similar pre-existing dataset. The promising results obtained from this approach, emphasize the need of promoting and improving systematic data sharing across the research community to facilitate plasmode building. Although we illustrate the use of plasmode for comparing differential expression analysis models, the flexibility of plasmode construction allows comparing upstream analysis, as normalization procedures or alignment pipelines, as well.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been a long-standing need in biomedical research for a method that quantifies the normally mixed composition of leukocytes beyond what is possible by simple histological or flow cytometric assessments. The latter is restricted by the labile nature of protein epitopes, requirements for cell processing, and timely cell analysis. In a diverse array of diseases and following numerous immune-toxic exposures, leukocyte composition will critically inform the underlying immuno-biology to most chronic medical conditions. Emerging research demonstrates that DNA methylation is responsible for cellular differentiation, and when measured in whole peripheral blood, serves to distinguish cancer cases from controls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we present a method, similar to regression calibration, for inferring changes in the distribution of white blood cells between different subpopulations (e.g. cases and controls) using DNA methylation signatures, in combination with a previously obtained external validation set consisting of signatures from purified leukocyte samples. We validate the fundamental idea in a cell mixture reconstruction experiment, then demonstrate our method on DNA methylation data sets from several studies, including data from a Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) study and an ovarian cancer study. Our method produces results consistent with prior biological findings, thereby validating the approach.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our method, in combination with an appropriate external validation set, promises new opportunities for large-scale immunological studies of both disease states and noxious exposures.},

abstract = {The use of mouse blood as a model for human blood is often considered in the development of clinically relevant, gene expression-based disease biomarkers. However, the ability to derive biologically meaningful insights from microarray-based gene expression patterns in mouse whole blood, as in human whole blood, is hindered by high levels of globin mRNA. In order to characterize the effects of globin reduction on gene expression of peripheral mouse blood, we performed gene set enrichment analysis on genes identified as expressed in blood via microarray-based genome-wide transcriptome analysis. Depletion of globin mRNA enhanced the quality of microarray data as shown by improved gene expression detection and increased sensitivity. Compared to genes expressed in whole blood, genes detected as expressed in blood following globin reduction were enriched for low abundance transcripts implicated in many biological pathways, including development, g-protein signaling, and immune response. Broadly, globin reduction resulted in improved detection of expressed genes that serve as molecular binding proteins and enzymes in cellular metabolism, intracellular transport/localization, transcription, and translation, as well as genes that potentially could act as biomarkers for diseases such as schizophrenia. These significantly enriched pathways overlap considerably with those identified in globin-reduced human blood suggesting that globin-reduced mouse blood gene expression studies may be useful for identifying genes relevant to human disease. Overall, the results of this investigation provide a better understanding of the impact of reducing globin transcripts in mouse blood and highlight the potential of microarray-based, globin-reduced, mouse blood gene expression studies in biomarker development.},

abstract = {Verifying that a statistically significant result is scientifically meaningful is not only good scientific practice, it is a natural way to control the Type I error rate. Here we introduce a novel extension of the p-value – a second-generation p-value p{\_}delta – that formally accounts for scientific relevance and leverages this natural Type I Error control. The approach relies on a pre-specified interval null hypothesis that represents the collection of effect sizes that are scientifically uninteresting or are practically null. The second-generation p-value is the proportion of datasupported hypotheses that are also null hypotheses. As such, second-generation p-values indicate when the data are compatible with null hypotheses p{\_}delta = 1 , or with alternative hypotheses p{\_}delta = 0 , or when the data are inconclusive 0 {\textless} p{\_}delta {\textless} 1 . Moreover, secondgeneration p-values provide a proper scientific adjustment for multiple comparisons and reduce false discovery rates. This is an advance for environments rich in data, where traditional p-value adjustments are needlessly punitive. Second-generation p-values promote transparency, rigor and reproducibility of scientific results by a priori specifying which candidate hypotheses are practically meaningful and by providing a more reliable statistical summary of when the data are compatible with alternative or null hypotheses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative RNA splicing greatly increases proteome diversity and thereby contribute to species- or tissue-specific functions. The possibility to study alternative splicing (AS) events on a genomic scale using splicing-sensitive microarrays, including the Affymetrix GeneChip Exon 1.0 ST microarray (exon array), has appeared very recently. However, the application of this new technology is hindered by the lack of free and user-friendly software devoted to these novel platforms.

RESULTS: In this study we present a Java-based freeware, easyExon http://microarray.ym.edu.tw/easyexon, to process, filtrate and visualize exon array data with an analysis pipeline. This tool implements the most commonly used probeset summarization methods as well as AS-orientated filtration algorithms, e.g. MIDAS and PAC, for the detection of alternative splicing events. We include a biological filtration function according to GO terms, and provide a module to visualize and interpret the selected exons and transcripts. Furthermore, easyExon can integrate with other related programs, such as Integrate Genome Browser (IGB) and Affymetrix Power Tools (APT), to make the whole analysis more comprehensive. We applied easyExon on a public accessible colon cancer dataset as an example to illustrate the analysis pipeline of this tool.

CONCLUSION: EasyExon can efficiently process and analyze the Affymetrix exon array data. The simplicity, flexibility and brevity of easyExon make it a valuable tool for AS event identification in genomic research.},

abstract = {Land cover and land use classifications from remote sensing are increasingly becoming institutionalized framework data sets for monitoring environmental change. As such, the need for robust statements of classification accuracy is critical. This paper describes a method to estimate confidence in classification model accuracy using a bootstrap approach. Using this method, it was found that classification accuracy and confidence, while closely related, can be used in complementary ways to provide additional information on map accuracy and define groups of classes and to inform the future reference sampling strategies. Overall classification accuracy increases with an increase in the number of fields surveyed, where the width of classification confidence bounds decreases. Individual class accuracies and confidence were non-linearly related to the number of fields surveyed. Results indicate that some classes can be estimated accurately and confidently with fewer numbers of samples, whereas others require larger reference data sets to achieve satisfactory results. This approach is an improvement over other approaches for estimating class accuracy and confidence as it uses repetitive sampling to produce a more realistic estimate of the range in classification accuracy and confidence that can be obtained with different reference data inputs. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing allows us to sequence reads from a microbial environment using single-cell sequencing or metagenomic sequencing technologies. However, both technologies suffer from the problem that sequencing depth of different regions of a genome or genomes from different species are highly uneven. Most existing genome assemblers usually have an assumption that sequencing depths are even. These assemblers fail to construct correct long contigs.

RESULTS: We introduce the IDBA-UD algorithm that is based on the de Bruijn graph approach for assembling reads from single-cell sequencing or metagenomic sequencing technologies with uneven sequencing depths. Several non-trivial techniques have been employed to tackle the problems. Instead of using a simple threshold, we use multiple depthrelative thresholds to remove erroneous k-mers in both low-depth and high-depth regions. The technique of local assembly with paired-end information is used to solve the branch problem of low-depth short repeat regions. To speed up the process, an error correction step is conducted to correct reads of high-depth regions that can be aligned to highconfident contigs. Comparison of the performances of IDBA-UD and existing assemblers (Velvet, Velvet-SC, SOAPdenovo and Meta-IDBA) for different datasets, shows that IDBA-UD can reconstruct longer contigs with higher accuracy.

The vast amount of data and biases introduced by sequencing and/or genome mapping pose new challenges and call for effective methods and fast computer programs for statistical analysis. To systematically model ChIP-seq data, we build a dynamic signal profile for each chromosome and then model the profile using a fully Bayesian hidden Ising model. The proposed model naturally takes into account spatial dependency and global and local distributions of sequence tags. It can be used for one-sample and two-sample analyses. Through model diagnosis, the proposed method can detect falsely enriched regions caused by sequencing and/or mapping errors, which is usually not offered by the existing hypothesis-testing-based methods. The proposed method is illustrated using 3 transcription factor (TF) ChIP-seq data sets and 2 mixed ChIP-seq data sets and compared with 4 popular and/or well-documented methods: MACS, CisGenome, BayesPeak, and SISSRs. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves equivalent or higher sensitivity and spatial resolution in detecting TF binding sites with false discovery rate at a much lower level.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by guiding Argonaute proteins to specific target mRNA sequences. Identification of bona fide miRNA target sites in animals is challenging because of uncertainties regarding the base-pairing requirements between miRNA and target as well as the location of functional binding sites within mRNAs. Here we present the results of a comprehensive strategy aimed at isolating endogenous mRNA target sequences bound by the Argonaute protein ALG-1 in C. elegans. Using cross-linking and ALG-1 immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq), we identified extensive ALG-1 interactions with specific 3' untranslated region (UTR) and coding exon sequences and discovered features that distinguish miRNA complex binding sites in 3' UTRs from those in other genic regions. Furthermore, our analyses revealed a striking enrichment of Argonaute binding sites in genes important for miRNA function, suggesting an autoregulatory role that may confer robustness to the miRNA pathway.},

abstract = {The RNA-binding protein nuclear factor 90 (NF90) has been implicated in the stabilization, transport and translational control of several target mRNAs. However, a systematic analysis of NF90 target mRNAs has not been performed. Here, we use ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation analysis to identify a large subset of NF90-associated mRNAs. Comparison of the 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of these mRNAs led to the elucidation of a 25- to 30-nucleotide, RNA signature motif rich in adenines and uracils. Insertion of the AU-rich NF90 motif ('NF90m') in the 3'UTR of an EGFP heterologous reporter did not affect the steady-state level of the chimeric EGFP-NF90m mRNA or its cytosolic abundance. Instead, the translation of EGFP-NF90m mRNA was specifically repressed in an NF90-dependent manner, as determined by analysing nascent EGFP translation, the distribution of chimeric mRNAs on polysome gradients and the steady-state levels of expressed EGFP protein. The interaction of endogenous NF90 with target mRNAs was validated after testing both endogenous mRNAs and recombinant biotinylated transcripts containing NF90 motif hits. Further analysis showed that the stability of endogenous NF90 target mRNAs was not significantly influenced by NF90 abundance, while their translation increased when NF90 levels were reduced. In summary, we have identified an AU-rich RNA motif present in NF90 target mRNAs and have obtained evidence that NF90 represses the translation of this subset of mRNAs.},

abstract = {Identifying latent structure in high-dimensional genomic data is essential for exploring biological processes. Here, we consider recovering gene co-expression networks from gene expression data, where each network encodes relationships between genes that are co-regulated by shared biological mechanisms. To do this, we develop a Bayesian statistical model for biclustering to infer subsets of co-regulated genes that covary in all of the samples or in only a subset of the samples. Our biclustering method, BicMix, allows overcomplete representations of the data, computational tractability, and joint modeling of unknown confounders and biological signals. Compared with related biclustering methods, BicMix recovers latent structure with higher precision across diverse simulation scenarios as compared to state-of-the-art biclustering methods. Further, we develop a principled method to recover context specific gene co-expression networks from the estimated sparse biclustering matrices. We apply BicMix to breast cancer gene expression data and to gene expression data from a cardiovascular study cohort, and we recover gene co-expression networks that are differential across ER+ and ER- samples and across male and female samples. We apply BicMix to the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) pilot data, and we find tissue specific gene networks. We validate these findings by using our tissue specific networks to identify trans-eQTLs specific to one of four primary tissues.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Gene expression microarray experiments can generate data sets with multiple missing expression values. Unfortunately, many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a complete matrix of gene array values as input. For example, methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose effectiveness even with a few missing values. Methods for imputing missing data are needed, therefore, to minimize the effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to increase the range of data sets to which these algorithms can be applied. In this report, we investigate automated methods for estimating missing data. RESULTS: We present a comparative study of several methods for the estimation of missing values in gene microarray data. We implemented and evaluated three methods: a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute), weighted K-nearest neighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated the methods using a variety of parameter settings and over different real data sets, and assessed the robustness of the imputation methods to the amount of missing data over the range of 1--20{\%} missing values. We show that KNNimpute appears to provide a more robust and sensitive method for missing value estimation than SVDimpute, and both SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the commonly used row average method (as well as filling missing values with zeros). We report results of the comparative experiments and provide recommendations and tools for accurate estimation of missing microarray data under a variety of conditions.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: High-throughput experiments such as microarray hybridizations often yield long lists of genes found to share a certain characteristic such as differential expression. Exploring Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for such lists of genes has become a widespread practice to get first insights into the potential biological meaning of the experiment. The standard statistical approach to measuring overrepresentation of GO terms cannot cope with the dependencies resulting from the structure of GO because they analyze each term in isolation. Especially the fact that annotations are inherited from more specific descendant terms can result in certain types of false-positive results with potentially misleading biological interpretation, a phenomenon which we term the inheritance problem.

RESULTS: We present here a novel approach to analysis of GO term overrepresentation that determines overrepresentation of terms in the context of annotations to the term's parents. This approach reduces the dependencies between the individual term's measurements, and thereby avoids producing false-positive results owing to the inheritance problem. ROC analysis using study sets with overrepresented GO terms showed a clear advantage for our approach over the standard algorithm with respect to the inheritance problem. Although there can be no gold standard for exploratory methods such as analysis of GO term overrepresentation, analysis of biological datasets suggests that our algorithm tends to identify the core GO terms that are most characteristic of the dataset being analyzed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The oxidative burst is one of the major antimicrobial mechanisms adopted by macrophages. The WKY rat strain is uniquely susceptible to experimentally induced macrophage-dependent crescentic glomerulonephritis (Crgn). We previously identified the AP-1 transcription factor JunD as a determinant of macrophage activation in WKY bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). JunD is over-expressed in WKY BMDMs and its silencing reduces Fc receptor-mediated oxidative burst in these cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we combined Jund RNA interference with microarray analyses alongside ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) analyses in WKY BMDMs to investigate JunD-mediated control of macrophage activation in basal and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated cells. Microarray analysis following Jund silencing showed that Jund activates and represses gene expression with marked differential expression ({\textgreater}3 fold) for genes linked with oxidative stress and IL-1$\beta$ expression. These results were complemented by comparing whole genome expression in WKY BMDMs with Jund congenic strain (WKY.LCrgn2) BMDMs which express lower levels of JunD. ChIP-Seq analyses demonstrated that the increased expression of JunD resulted in an increased number of binding events in WKY BMDMs compared to WKY.LCrgn2 BMDMs. Combined ChIP-Seq and microarray analysis revealed a set of primary JunD-targets through which JunD exerts its effect on oxidative stress and IL-1$\beta$ synthesis in basal and LPS-stimulated macrophages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate how genetically determined levels of a transcription factor affect its binding sites in primary cells and identify JunD as a key regulator of oxidative stress and IL-1$\beta$ synthesis in primary macrophages, which may play a role in susceptibility to Crgn.},

Alteration of epigenetic modifications can be used as an epigenetic biomarker for diagnosis and as promising targets for epigenetic therapy. A recent study explored cancer-cell specific epigenetic biomarkers by examining different types of epigenetic modifications simultaneously. However, it was based on microarrays and reported biomarkers that were also present in normal cells at a low frequency. Here, we first analyzed multi-omics data (including ChIP-Seq data of six types of histone modifications: H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K9me3, H3K36me3, H3K27me3, and H3K4me3) obtained from 26 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and a normal cell line. We identified six genes with both H3K27ac and H3K4me3 histone modifications in their promoter regions, which were not present in the normal cell line, but present in ≥85{\%} (22 out of 26) and ≤96{\%} (25 out of 26) of the lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Of these genes, NUP210 (encoding a main component of the nuclear pore complex) was the only gene in which the two modifications were not detected in another normal cell line. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that NUP210 was aberrantly overexpressed among the 26 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, although the frequency of NUP210 overexpression was lower (19.3{\%}) in 57 lung adenocarcinoma tissue samples studied and stored in another database. This study provides a basis to discover epigenetic biomarkers highly specific to a certain cancer, based on multi-omics data at the cell population level.},

abstract = {Robust multiarray analysis (RMA) is the most widely used preprocessing algorithm for Affymetrix and Nimblegen gene expression microarrays. RMA performs background correction, normalization, and summarization in a modular way. The last 2 steps require multiple arrays to be analyzed simultaneously. The ability to borrow information across samples provides RMA various advantages. For example, the summarization step fits a parametric model that accounts for probe effects, assumed to be fixed across arrays, and improves outlier detection. Residuals, obtained from the fitted model, permit the creation of useful quality metrics. However, the dependence on multiple arrays has 2 drawbacks: (1) RMA cannot be used in clinical settings where samples must be processed individually or in small batches and (2) data sets preprocessed separately are not comparable. We propose a preprocessing algorithm, frozen RMA (fRMA), which allows one to analyze microarrays individually or in small batches and then combine the data for analysis. This is accomplished by utilizing information from the large publicly available microarray databases. In particular, estimates of probe-specific effects and variances are precomputed and frozen. Then, with new data sets, these are used in concert with information from the new arrays to normalize and summarize the data. We find that fRMA is comparable to RMA when the data are analyzed as a single batch and outperforms RMA when analyzing multiple batches. The methods described here are implemented in the R package fRMA and are currently available for download from the software section of http://rafalab.jhsph.edu.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: False discovery rate (FDR) methodologies are essential in the study of high-dimensional genomic and proteomic data. The R package 'fdrtool' facilitates such analyses by offering a comprehensive set of procedures for FDR estimation. Its distinctive features include: (i) many different types of test statistics are allowed as input data, such as P-values, z-scores, correlations and t-scores; (ii) simultaneously, both local FDR and tail area-based FDR values are estimated for all test statistics and (iii) empirical null models are fit where possible, thereby taking account of potential over- or underdispersion of the theoretical null. In addition, 'fdrtool' provides readily interpretable graphical output, and can be applied to very large scale (in the order of millions of hypotheses) multiple testing problems. Consequently, 'fdrtool' implements a flexible FDR estimation scheme that is unified across different test statistics and variants of FDR.

@article{Hart2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early application of second-generation sequencing technologies to transcript quantitation (RNA-seq) has hinted at a vast mammalian transcriptome, including transcripts from nearly all known genes, which might be fully measured only by ultradeep sequencing. Subsequent studies suggested that low-abundance transcripts might be the result of technical or biological noise rather than active transcripts; moreover, most RNA-seq experiments did not provide enough read depth to generate high-confidence estimates of gene expression for low-abundance transcripts. As a result, the community adopted several heuristics for RNA-seq analysis, most notably an arbitrary expression threshold of 0.3 - 1 FPKM for downstream analysis. However, advances in RNA-seq library preparation, sequencing technology, and informatic analysis have addressed many of the systemic sources of uncertainty and undermined the assumptions that drove the adoption of these heuristics. We provide an updated view of the accuracy and efficiency of RNA-seq experiments, using genomic data from large-scale studies like the ENCODE project to provide orthogonal information against which to validate our conclusions.

RESULTS: We show that a human cell's transcriptome can be divided into active genes carrying out the work of the cell and other genes that are likely the by-products of biological or experimental noise. We use ENCODE data on chromatin state to show that ultralow-expression genes are predominantly associated with repressed chromatin; we provide a novel normalization metric, zFPKM, that identifies the threshold between active and background gene expression; and we show that this threshold is robust to experimental and analytical variations.

CONCLUSIONS: The zFPKM normalization method accurately separates the biologically relevant genes in a cell, which are associated with active promoters, from the ultralow-expression noisy genes that have repressed promoters. A read depth of twenty to thirty million mapped reads allows high-confidence quantitation of genes expressed at this threshold, providing important guidance for the design of RNA-seq studies of gene expression. Moreover, we offer an example for using extensive ENCODE chromatin state information to validate RNA-seq analysis pipelines.},

This depletion is highly specific and is achieved with minimal perturbation of miRNA and piRNA profiles.},

abstract = {Scientists use high-dimensional measurement assays to detect and prioritize regions of strong signal in a spatially organized domain. Examples include finding methylation enriched genomic regions using microarrays and identifying active cortical areas using brain-imaging. The most common procedure for detecting potential regions is to group together neighboring sites where the signal passed a threshold. However, one needs to account for the selection bias induced by this opportunistic procedure to avoid diminishing e↵ects when generalizing to a population. In this paper, we present a model and a method that permit population inference for these de-tected regions. In particular, we provide non-asymptotic point and confidence interval estimates for mean e↵ect in the region, which account for the local selection bias and the non-stationary covariance that is typical of these data. Such summaries allow researchers to better compare regions of di↵erent sizes and di↵erent correlation structures. Inference is provided within a conditional one-parameter exponential family for each region, with truncations that match the constraints of selection. A secondary screening-and-adjustment step allows pruning the set of detected regions, while controlling the false-coverage rate for the set of regions that are re-ported. We illustrate the benefits of the method by applying it to detected genomic regions with di↵ering DNA-methylation rates across tissue types. Our method is shown to provide superior power compared to non-parametric approaches.},

We give an explicit formulation for this P-value, and find by simulation that it can provide high power for detecting departures from the overall hypothesis. We extend the procedure to situations when tests are not independent. We present both real and simulated examples where the method is especially useful. These include exploratory analyses when L is large, such as genome-wide scans for marker-trait associations and meta-analytic applications that combine information from published studies, with potential for dealing with the "publication bias" phenomenon. Once the overall hypothesis is rejected, an adjustment procedure with strong family-wise error protection is available for smaller subsets of hypotheses, down to the individual tests.},

RESULTS: We present a method, t-tests relative to a threshold (TREAT), that allows researchers to test formally the hypothesis (with associated p-values) that the differential expression in a microarray experiment is greater than a given (biologically meaningful) threshold. We have evaluated the method using simulated data, a dataset from a quality control experiment for microarrays and data from a biological experiment investigating histone deacetylase inhibitors. When the magnitude of differential expression is taken into account, TREAT improves upon the false discovery rate of existing methods and identifies more biologically relevant genes.

abstract = {Ultra-high-throughput sequencing is emerging as an attractive alternative to microarrays for genotyping, analysis of methylation patterns, and identification of transcription factor binding sites. Here, we describe an application of the Illumina sequencing (formerly Solexa sequencing) platform to study mRNA expression levels. Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney RNA samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the same RNA samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol and a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology.},

abstract = {Orthology detection is critically important for accurate functional annotation, and has been widely used to facilitate studies on comparative and evolutionary genomics. Although various methods are now available, there has been no comprehensive analysis of performance, due to the lack of a genomic-scale 'gold standard' orthology dataset. Even in the absence of such datasets, the comparison of results from alternative methodologies contains useful information, as agreement enhances confidence and disagreement indicates possible errors. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) is a statistical technique that can exploit this information to reasonably infer sensitivities and specificities, and is applied here to evaluate the performance of various orthology detection methods on a eukaryotic dataset. Overall, we observe a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity in orthology detection, with BLAST-based methods characterized by high sensitivity, and tree-based methods by high specificity. Two algorithms exhibit the best overall balance, with both sensitivity and specificity{\textgreater}80{\%}: INPARANOID identifies orthologs across two species while OrthoMCL clusters orthologs from multiple species. Among methods that permit clustering of ortholog groups spanning multiple genomes, the (automated) OrthoMCL algorithm exhibits better within-group consistency with respect to protein function and domain architecture than the (manually curated) KOG database, and the homolog clustering algorithm TribeMCL as well. By way of using LCA, we are also able to comprehensively assess similarities and statistical dependence between various strategies, and evaluate the effects of parameter settings on performance. In summary, we present a comprehensive evaluation of orthology detection on a divergent set of eukaryotic genomes, thus providing insights and guides for method selection, tuning and development for different applications. Many biological questions have been addressed by multiple tests yielding binary (yes/no) outcomes but no clear definition of truth, making LCA an attractive approach for computational biology.},

abstract = {DNA methylation participates in establishing and maintaining chromatin structures and regulates gene transcription during mammalian development and cellular differentiation. With few exceptions, research thus far has focused on gene promoters, and little is known about the extent, functional relevance, and regulation of cell type-specific DNA meth- ylation at promoter-distal sites. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of differential DNA methylation in human conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconv) and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg), cell types whose differentiation and function are known to be controlled by epigenetic mechanisms. Using a novel approach that is based on the separation of a genome into methylated and unmethylated fractions, we examined the extent of lineage-specific DNA methylation across whole gene loci. More than 100 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified that are present mainly in cell type-specific genes (e.g., FOXP3, IL2RA, CTLA4, CD40LG, and IFNG) and show differential patterns of histone H3 lysine 4 methylation. Interestingly, the majority of DMRs were located at promoter-distal sites, and many of these areas harbor DNAmethylation-dependent enhancer activity in reporter gene assays. Thus, our study provides a comprehensive, locus- wide analysis of lineage-specific methylation patterns in Treg and Tconv cells, links cell type-specific DNA methylation with histone methylation and regulatory function, and identifies a number of cell type-specific, CpG methylation- sensitive enhancers in immunologically relevant genes.},

@article{Zhu2018,
abstract = {In RNA-seq differential expression analysis, investigators aim to detect those genes with changes in expression level across experimental conditions, despite technical and biological variability in the observations. A common task is to accurately estimate the effect size, often in terms of a logarithmic fold change (LFC) in expression levels. When the counts of reads are low or highly variable in either or both conditions, the maximum likelihood estimates for the LFCs has high variance, leading to large estimates not representative of true differences, and poor ranking of genes by effect size. One approach is to introduce filtering thresholds and pseudocounts to exclude or moderate estimated LFCs. Filtering may result in a loss of genes from the analysis with true differences in expression across conditions, while pseudocounts provide a limited solution that needs to be adapted per dataset. Here, we propose the use of a heavy-tailed Cauchy prior distribution for effect sizes, which avoids the use of filter thresholds or pseudocounts. The proposed method, Approximate Posterior Estimation for GLM, apeglm, has lower bias than previously proposed shrinkage estimators, while still reducing variance for those genes with little information for statistical inference. The apeglm package is available as an R/Bioconductor package at http://bioconductor.org/packages/apeglm, and the methods can be called from within the DESeq2 software.},

@article{Gunady2018,
abstract = {Introduction: Analysis of differential alternative splicing from RNA-seq data is complicated by the fact that many RNA-seq reads map to multiple transcripts, besides, the annotated transcripts are often a small subset of the possible transcripts of a gene. Here we describe Yanagi, a tool for segmenting transcriptome to create a library of maximal L-disjoint segments from a complete transcriptome annotation. That segment library preserves all transcriptome substrings of length L and transcripts structural relationships while eliminating unnecessary sequence duplications. Contributions: In this paper, we formalize the concept of transcriptome segmentation and propose an efficient algorithm for generating segment libraries based on a length parameter dependent on specific RNA-Seq library construction. The resulting segment sequences can be used with pseudo-alignment tools to quantify expression at the segment level. We characterize the segment libraries for the reference transcriptomes of Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens and provide gene-level visualization of the segments for better interpretability. Then we demonstrate the use of segments-level quantification into gene expression and alternative splicing analysis. The notion of transcript segmentation as introduced here and implemented in Yanagi opens the door for the application of lightweight, ultra-fast pseudo-alignment algorithms in a wide variety of RNA-seq analyses. Conclusion: Using segment library rather than the standard transcriptome succeeds in significantly reducing ambigious alignments where reads are multimapped to several sequences in the reference. That allowed avoiding the quantification step required by standard kmer-based pipelines for gene expression analysis. Moreover, using segment counts as statistics for alternative splicing analysis enables achieving comparable performance to counting-based approaches (e.g. rMATS) while rather using fast and lighthweight pseudo alignment.},

These dimensions include myriad properties describing genome, epigenome, transcriptome, microbiome, phenotype, and lifestyle. No single data type, however, can capture the complexity of all the factors relevant to understanding a phenomenon such as a disease. Integrative methods that combine data from multiple technologies have thus emerged as critical statistical and computational approaches. The key challenge in developing such approaches is the identification of effective models to provide a comprehensive and relevant systems view. An ideal method can answer a biological or medical question, identifying important fea-tures and predicting outcomes, by harnessing heterogeneous data across several dimensions of biological variation. In this Review, we describe the principles of data integration and discuss current methods and available implementations. We provide examples of successful data integration in biology and medicine.

abstract = {Priming of random hexamers in cDNA synthesis is known to show sequence bias, but in addition it has been suggested recently that mismatches in random hexamer priming could be a cause of mismatches between the original RNA fragment and observed sequence reads. To explore random hexamer mispriming as a potential source of these errors, we analyzed two independently generated RNA-seq datasets of synthetic ERCC spikes for which the reference is known. First strand cDNA synthesized by random hexamer priming on RNA showed consistent position and nucleotide-specific mismatch errors in the first seven nucleotides. The mismatch errors found in both datasets are consistent in distribution and thermodynamically stable mismatches are more common. This strongly indicates that RNA-DNA mispriming of specific random hexamers causes these errors. Due to their consistency and specificity, mispriming errors can have profound implications for downstream applications if not dealt with properly.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Finding genes that are differentially expressed between conditions is an integral part of understanding the molecular basis of phenotypic variation. In the past decades, DNA microarrays have been used extensively to quantify the abundance of mRNA corresponding to different genes, and more recently high-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful competitor. As the cost of sequencing decreases, it is conceivable that the use of RNA-seq for differential expression analysis will increase rapidly. To exploit the possibilities and address the challenges posed by this relatively new type of data, a number of software packages have been developed especially for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data.

RESULTS: We conducted an extensive comparison of eleven methods for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. All methods are freely available within the R framework and take as input a matrix of counts, i.e. the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature of interest in each of a number of samples. We evaluate the methods based on both simulated data and real RNA-seq data.

CONCLUSIONS: Very small sample sizes, which are still common in RNA-seq experiments, impose problems for all evaluated methods and any results obtained under such conditions should be interpreted with caution. For larger sample sizes, the methods combining a variance-stabilizing transformation with the 'limma' method for differential expression analysis perform well under many different conditions, as does the nonparametric SAMseq method.},

Separating the paternal and maternal chromosomes is an important component of genetic analyses such as determining genetic association, inferring evolutionary scenarios, computing recombination rates, and detecting cis-regulatory events. As the pair of chromosomes are mostly identical to each other, linking together of alleles at heterozygous sites is sufficient to phase, or separate the two chromosomes. In Haplotype Assembly, the linking is done by sequenced fragments that overlap two heterozygous sites. While there has been a lot of research on correcting errors to achieve accurate haplotypes via assembly, relatively little work has been done on designing sequencing experiments to get long haplotypes.

The monomethylations of H3K27, H3K9, H4K20, H3K79, and H2BK5 are all linked to gene activation, whereas trimethylations of H3K27, H3K9, and H3K79 are linked to repression. H2A.Z associates with functional regulatory elements, and CTCF marks boundaries of histone methylation domains. Chromosome banding patterns are correlated with unique patterns of histone modifications. Chromosome breakpoints detected in T cell cancers frequently reside in chromatin regions associated with H3K4 methylations. Our data provide new insights into the function of histone methylation and chromatin organization in genome function.},

abstract = {In the biology of tissue development and diseases, DNA methylation plays an important role. For a deeper understanding, it is crucial to accurately compare DNA methylation patterns between groups of samples representing different conditions. A widely used method to investigate DNA methylation in the CpG context is bisulfite sequencing, which produces data on the single-nucleotide scale. While there are benefits to analyzing CpG sites on a basepair level, there are both biological and statistical reasons to test entire genomic regions for differential methylation. However, the analysis of DNA methylation is hampered by the lack of best practice standards. Here, we compared multiple approaches for testing predefined genomic regions for differential DNA methylation in bisulfite sequencing data. Nine methods were evaluated: BiSeq, COHCAP, Goeman's Global Test, Limma, methylKit/eDMR, RADMeth and three log-linear regression approaches with different distribution assumptions. We applied these methods to simulated data and determined their sensitivity and specificity. This revealed performance differences, which were also seen when applied to real data. Methods that first test single CpG sites and then test regions based on transformed CpG-wise P-values performed better than methods that summarize methylation levels or raw reads. Interestingly, smoothing of methylation levels had a negligible impact. In particular, Global Test, BiSeq and RADMeth/z-test outperformed the other methods we evaluated, providing valuable guidance for more accurate analysis of DNA methylation.},

abstract = {The Affymetrix GeneChip Exon Array can be used to detect alternative splice variants. Microarray Detection of Alternative Splicing (MIDAS) and Partek({\textregistered}) Genomics Suite (Partek({\textregistered}) GS) are among the most popular analytical methods used to analyze exon array data. While both methods utilize statistical significance for testing, MIDAS and Partek({\textregistered}) GS could produce somewhat different results due to different underlying assumptions. Comparing MIDAS and Partek({\textregistered}) GS is quite difficult due to their substantially different mathematical formulations and assumptions regarding alternative splice variants. For meaningful comparison, we have used the previously published generalized probe model (GPM) which encompasses both MIDAS and Partek({\textregistered}) GS under different assumptions. We analyzed a colon cancer exon array data set using MIDAS, Partek({\textregistered}) GS and GPM. MIDAS and Partek({\textregistered}) GS produced quite different sets of genes that are considered to have alternative splice variants. Further, we found that GPM produced results similar to MIDAS as well as to Partek({\textregistered}) GS under their respective assumptions. Within the GPM, we show how discoveries relating to alternative variants can be quite different due to different assumptions. MIDAS focuses on relative changes in expression values across different exons within genes and tends to be robust but less efficient. Partek({\textregistered}) GS, however, uses absolute expression values of individual exons within genes and tends to be more efficient but more sensitive to the presence of outliers. From our observations, we conclude that MIDAS and Partek({\textregistered}) GS produce complementary results, and discoveries from both analyses should be considered.},

abstract = {High-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) promises simultaneous transcript discovery and abundance estimation. However, this would require algorithms that are not restricted by prior gene annotations and that account for alternative transcription and splicing. Here we introduce such algorithms in an open-source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed {\textgreater}430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62{\%} of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Gene expression class comparison studies may identify hundreds or thousands of genes as differentially expressed (DE) between sample groups. Gaining biological insight from the result of such experiments can be approached, for instance, by identifying the signaling pathways impacted by the observed changes. Most of the existing pathway analysis methods focus on either the number of DE genes observed in a given pathway (enrichment analysis methods), or on the correlation between the pathway genes and the class of the samples (functional class scoring methods). Both approaches treat the pathways as simple sets of genes, disregarding the complex gene interactions that these pathways are built to describe.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:We describe a novel signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) that combines the evidence obtained from the classical enrichment analysis with a novel type of evidence, which measures the actual perturbation on a given pathway under a given condition. A bootstrap procedure is used to assess the significance of the observed total pathway perturbation. Using simulations we show that the evidence derived from perturbations is independent of the pathway enrichment evidence. This allows us to calculate a global pathway significance P-value, which combines the enrichment and perturbation P-values. We illustrate the capabilities of the novel method on four real datasets. The results obtained on these data show that SPIA has better specificity and more sensitivity than several widely used pathway analysis methods.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY:SPIA was implemented as an R package available at http://vortex.cs.wayne.edu/ontoexpress/},

This leads to a nonparametric empirical Bayes testing procedure, which we call PRtest, based on thresholding the estimated local false discovery rates.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Although chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) or tiling array hybridization (ChIP-chip) is increasingly used to map genome-wide-binding sites of transcription factors (TFs), it still remains difficult to generate a quality ChIPx (i.e. ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip) dataset because of the tremendous amount of effort required to develop effective antibodies and efficient protocols. Moreover, most laboratories are unable to easily obtain ChIPx data for one or more TF(s) in more than a handful of biological contexts. Thus, standard ChIPx analyses primarily focus on analyzing data from one experiment, and the discoveries are restricted to a specific biological context. RESULTS: We propose to enrich this existing data analysis paradigm by developing a novel approach, ChIP-PED, which superimposes ChIPx data on large amounts of publicly available human and mouse gene expression data containing a diverse collection of cell types, tissues and disease conditions to discover new biological contexts with potential TF regulatory activities. We demonstrate ChIP-PED using a number of examples, including a novel discovery that MYC, a human TF, plays an important functional role in pediatric Ewing sarcoma cell lines. These examples show that ChIP-PED increases the value of ChIPx data by allowing one to expand the scope of possible discoveries made from a ChIPx experiment.

RESULTS: In this work, we propose a statistical procedure to identify genes that show different gene expression profiles across analytical groups in time-course experiments. The method is a two-regression step approach where the experimental groups are identified by dummy variables. The procedure first adjusts a global regression model with all the defined variables to identify differentially expressed genes, and in second a variable selection strategy is applied to study differences between groups and to find statistically significant different profiles. The methodology is illustrated on both a real and a simulated microarray dataset.},

abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

In many applications, the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene.

It works with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different sequencing applications.$\backslash$nAvailability and implementation: featureCounts is available under GNU General Public License as part of the Subread (http://subread.sourceforge.net) or Rsubread (http://www.bioconductor.org) software packages.$\backslash$nContact: shi@wehi.edu.au},

abstract = {SUMMARY: The assessment of data quality is a major concern in microarray analysis. arrayQualityMetrics is a Bioconductor package that provides a report with diagnostic plots for one or two colour microarray data. The quality metrics assess reproducibility, identify apparent outlier arrays and compute measures of signal-to-noise ratio. The tool handles most current microarray technologies and is amenable to use in automated analysis pipelines or for automatic report generation, as well as for use by individuals. The diagnosis of quality remains, in principle, a context-dependent judgement, but our tool provides powerful, automated, objective and comprehensive instruments on which to base a decision. AVAILABILITY: arrayQualityMetrics is a free and open source package, under LGPL license, available from the Bioconductor project at www.bioconductor.org.

@article{Ritchie2006,
abstract = {Background: Assessment of array quality is an essential step in the analysis of data from microarray experiments. Once detected, less reliable arrays are typically excluded or "filtered" from further analysis to avoid misleading results. Results: In this article, a graduated approach to array quality is considered based on empirical reproducibility of the gene expression measures from replicate arrays. Weights are assigned to each microarray by fitting a heteroscedastic linear model with shared array variance terms. A novel gene-by-gene update algorithm is used to efficiently estimate the array variances. The inverse variances are used as weights in the linear model analysis to identify differentially expressed genes. The method successfully assigns lower weights to less reproducible arrays from different experiments. Down-weighting the observations from suspect arrays increases the power to detect differential expression. In smaller experiments, this approach outperforms the usual method of filtering the data. The method is available in the limma software package which is implemented in the R software environment. Conclusion: This method complements existing normalisation and spot quality procedures, and allows poorer quality arrays, which would otherwise be discarded, to be included in an analysis. It is applicable to microarray data from experiments with some level of replication. {\textcopyright} 2006 Ritchie et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

@article{Liu2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 The Author(s).Variations in sample quality are frequently encountered in small RNA-sequencing experiments, and pose a major challenge in a differential expression analysis. Removal of high variation samples reduces noise, but at a cost of reducing power, thus limiting our ability to detect biologically meaningful changes. Similarly, retaining these samples in the analysis may not reveal any statistically significant changes due to the higher noise level. A compromise is to use all available data, but to down-weight the observations from more variable samples. We describe a statistical approach that facilitates this by modelling heterogeneity at both the sample and observational levels as part of the differential expression analysis. At the sample level this is achieved by fitting a log-linear variance model that includes common sample-specific or group-specific parameters that are shared between genes. The estimated sample variance factors are then converted to weights and combined with observational level weights obtained from the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts-per-million using 'voom'. A comprehensive analysis involving both simulations and experimental RNA-sequencing data demonstrates that this strategy leads to a universally more powerful analysis and fewer false discoveries when compared to conventional approaches. This methodology has wide application and is implemented in the open-source 'limma' package.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A model-based analysis of oligonucleotide expression arrays we developed previously uses a probe-sensitivity index to capture the response characteristic of a specific probe pair and calculates model-based expression indexes (MBEI). MBEI has standard error attached to it as a measure of accuracy. Here we investigate the stability of the probe-sensitivity index across different tissue types, the reproducibility of results in replicate experiments, and the use of MBEI in perfect match (PM)-only arrays.

RESULTS: Probe-sensitivity indexes are stable across tissue types. The target gene's presence in many arrays of an array set allows the probe-sensitivity index to be estimated accurately. We extended the model to obtain expression values for PM-only arrays, and found that the 20-probe PM-only model is comparable to the 10-probe PM/MM difference model, in terms of the expression correlations with the original 20-probe PM/MM difference model. MBEI method is able to extend the reliable detection limit of expression to a lower mRNA concentration. The standard errors of MBEI can be used to construct confidence intervals of fold changes, and the lower confidence bound of fold change is a better ranking statistic for filtering genes. We can assign reliability indexes for genes in a specific cluster of interest in hierarchical clustering by resampling clustering trees. A software dChip implementing many of these analysis methods is made available.

CONCLUSIONS: The model-based approach reduces the variability of low expression estimates, and provides a natural method of calculating expression values for PM-only arrays. The standard errors attached to expression values can be used to assess the reliability of downstream analysis.},

Thus, though kidney transplant biopsies remain the gold standard, they are invasive, have substantial risks, sampling error issues and significant costs and are not suitable for serial monitoring. Global gene expression profiles of 148 peripheral blood samples from transplant patients with excellent function and normal histology (TX; n = 46), AR (n = 63) and ADNR (n = 39), from two independent cohorts were analyzed with DNA microarrays. We applied a new normalization tool, frozen robust multi-array analysis, particularly suitable for clinical diagnostics, multiple prediction tools to discover, refine and validate robust molecular classifiers and we tested a novel one-by-one analysis strategy to model the real clinical application of this test. Multiple three-way classifier tools identified 200 highest value probesets with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area under the curve for the validation cohort ranging from 82{\%} to 100{\%}, 76{\%} to 95{\%}, 76{\%} to 95{\%}, 79{\%} to 100{\%}, 84{\%} to 100{\%} and 0.817 to 0.968, respectively.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: data generated using 'omics' technologies are characterized by high dimensionality, where the number of features measured per subject vastly exceeds the number of subjects in the study. In this paper, we consider issues relevant in the design of biomedical studies in which the goal is the discovery of a subset of features and an associated algorithm that can predict a binary outcome, such as disease status. We compare the performance of four commonly used classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors, Prediction Analysis for Microarrays, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines) in high-dimensionality data settings. We evaluate the effects of varying levels of signal-to-noise ratio in the dataset, imbalance in class distribution and choice of metric for quantifying performance of the classifier. To guide study design, we present a summary of the key characteristics of 'omics' data profiled in several human or animal model experiments utilizing high-content mass spectrometry and multiplexed immunoassay based techniques.

RESULTS: the analysis of data from seven 'omics' studies revealed that the average magnitude of effect size observed in human studies was markedly lower when compared to that in animal studies. The data measured in human studies were characterized by higher biological variation and the presence of outliers. The results from simulation studies indicated that the classifier Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM) had the highest power when the class conditional feature distributions were Gaussian and outcome distributions were balanced. Random Forests was optimal when feature distributions were skewed and when class distributions were unbalanced. We provide a free open-source R statistical software library (MVpower) that implements the simulation strategy proposed in this paper.

CONCLUSION: no single classifier had optimal performance under all settings. Simulation studies provide useful guidance for the design of biomedical studies involving high-dimensionality data.},

Normalization techniques aim to correct such biases. Most existing methods require multiple samples to be processed in aggregate; consequently, each sample's output is influenced by other samples processed jointly. However, in personalized-medicine workflows, samples may arrive serially, so renormalizing all samples upon each new arrival would be impractical. We have developed Single Channel Array Normalization (SCAN), a single-sample technique that models the effects of probe-nucleotide composition on fluorescence intensity and corrects for such effects, dramatically increasing the signal-to-noise ratio within individual samples while decreasing variation across samples. In various benchmark comparisons, we show that SCAN performs as well as or better than competing methods yet has no dependence on external reference samples and can be applied to any single-channel microarray platform.},

abstract = {Robust multiarray analysis (RMA) is the most widely used preprocessing algorithm for Affymetrix and Nimblegen gene expression microarrays. RMA performs background correction, normalization, and summarization in a modular way. The last 2 steps require multiple arrays to be analyzed simultaneously. The ability to borrow information across samples provides RMA various advantages. For example, the summarization step fits a parametric model that accounts for probe effects, assumed to be fixed across arrays, and improves outlier detection. Residuals, obtained from the fitted model, permit the creation of useful quality metrics. However, the dependence on multiple arrays has 2 drawbacks: (1) RMA cannot be used in clinical settings where samples must be processed individually or in small batches and (2) data sets preprocessed separately are not comparable. We propose a preprocessing algorithm, frozen RMA (fRMA), which allows one to analyze microarrays individually or in small batches and then combine the data for analysis. This is accomplished by utilizing information from the large publicly available microarray databases. In particular, estimates of probe-specific effects and variances are precomputed and frozen. Then, with new data sets, these are used in concert with information from the new arrays to normalize and summarize the data. We find that fRMA is comparable to RMA when the data are analyzed as a single batch and outperforms RMA when analyzing multiple batches. The methods described here are implemented in the R package fRMA and are currently available for download from the software section of http://rafalab.jhsph.edu.},

abstract = {The epigenetic determinants driving the responses of CD4 T cells to antigen are currently an area of active research. Much has been done to characterize helper T-cell subsets and their associated genome-wide epigenetic patterns. In contrast, little is known about the dynamics of histone modifications during CD4 T-cell activation and the differential kinetics of these epigenetic marks between naive and memory T cells. In this study, we have detailed the dynamics of genome-wide promoter H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 over a time course during activation of human naive and memory CD4 T cells. Our results demonstrate that changes to H3K4 methylation occur relatively late after activation (5 days) and reinforce activation-induced upregulation of gene expression, affecting multiple pathways important to T-cell activation, differentiation and function. The dynamics and mapped pathways of H3K4 methylation are distinctly different in memory cells, which have substantially more promoters marked by H3K4me3 alone, reinforcing their more differentiated state. Our study provides the first data examining genome-wide histone modification dynamics during CD4 T-cell activation, providing insight into the cross talk between H3K4 methylation and gene expression, and underscoring the impact of these marks upon key pathways integral to CD4 T-cell activation and function.Genes and Immunity advance online publication, 12 May 2016; doi:10.1038/gene.2016.19.},

abstract = {The changes to the epigenetic landscape in response to Ag during CD4 T cell activation have not been well characterized. Although CD4 T cell subsets have been mapped globally for numerous epigenetic marks, little has been done to study their dynamics early after activation. We have studied changes to promoter H3K27me3 during activation of human naive and memory CD4 T cells. Our results show that these changes occur relatively early (1 d) after activation of naive and memory cells and that demethylation is the predominant change to H3K27me3 at this time point, reinforcing high expression of target genes. Additionally, inhibition of the H3K27 demethylase JMJD3 in naive CD4 T cells demonstrates how critically important molecules required for T cell differentiation, such as JAK2 and IL12RB2, are regulated by H3K27me3. Our results show that H3K27me3 is a dynamic and important epigenetic modification during CD4 T cell activation and that JMJD3-driven H3K27 demethylation is critical for CD4 T cell function.},

abstract = {Longevity mechanisms increase lifespan by counteracting the effects of aging. However, whether longevity mechanisms counteract the effects of aging continually throughout life, or whether they act during specific periods of life, preventing changes that precede mortality is unclear. Here, we uncover transcriptional drift, a phenomenon that describes how aging causes genes within functional groups to change expression in opposing directions. These changes cause a transcriptome-wide loss in mRNA stoichiometry and loss of co-expression patterns in aging animals, as compared to young adults. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, we show that extending lifespan by inhibiting serotonergic signals by the antidepressant mianserin attenuates transcriptional drift, allowing the preservation of a younger transcriptome into an older age. Our data are consistent with a model in which inhibition of serotonergic signals slows age-dependent physiological decline and the associated rise in mortality levels exclusively in young adults, thereby postponing the onset of major mortality.},

Second, a peak of enrichment around the transcription start site (TSS) is commonly associated with 'bivalent' genes, where H3K4me3 also marks the TSS. Finally and most surprisingly, we identified an enrichment profile with a peak in the promoter of genes that is associated with active transcription. Genes with each of these three profiles were found in different proportions in each of the cell types studied.

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing has greatly increased the scope and the resolution of transcriptional regulation study. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and ChIP-Seq experiments are now generating comprehensive data on transcript abundance and on regulator-DNA interactions. We propose an approach for an integrated analysis of these data based on feature extraction of ChIP-Seq signals, principal component analysis, and regression-based component selection. Compared with traditional methods, our approach not only offers higher power in predicting gene expression from ChIP-Seq data but also provides a way to capture cooperation among regulators. In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we find that a remarkably high proportion of variation in gene expression (65{\%}) can be explained by the binding signals of 12 transcription factors (TFs). Two groups of TFs are identified. Whereas the first group (E2f1, Myc, Mycn, and Zfx) act as activators in general, the second group (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Smad1, Stat3, Tcfcp2l1, and Esrrb) may serve as either activator or repressor depending on the target. The two groups of TFs cooperate tightly to activate genes that are differentially up-regulated in ESCs. In the absence of binding by the first group, the binding of the second group is associated with genes that are repressed in ESCs and derepressed upon early differentiation.},

abstract = {Next generation sequencing is quickly replacing microarrays as a technique to probe different molecular levels of the cell, such as DNA or RNA. The technology provides higher resolution, while reducing bias. RNA sequencing results in counts of RNA strands. This type of data imposes new statistical challenges. We present a novel, generic approach to model and analyze such data. Our approach aims at large flexibility of the likelihood (count) model and the regression model alike. Hence, a variety of count models is supported, such as the popular NB model, which accounts for overdispersion. In addition, complex, non-balanced designs and random effects are accommodated. Like some other methods, our method provides shrinkage of dispersion-related parameters. However, we extend it by enabling joint shrinkage of parameters, including those for which inference is desired. We argue that this is essential for Bayesian multiplicity correction. Shrinkage is effectuated by empirically estimating priors. We discuss several parametric (mixture) and non-parametric priors and develop procedures to estimate (parameters of) those. Inference is provided by means of local and Bayesian false discovery rates. We illustrate our method on several simulations and two data sets, also to compare it with other methods. Model- and data-based simulations show substantial improvements in the sensitivity at the given specificity. The data motivate the use of the ZI-NB as a powerful alternative to the NB, which results in higher detection rates for low-count data. Finally, compared with other methods, the results on small sample subsets are more reproducible when validated on their large sample complements, illustrating the importance of the type of shrinkage.},
